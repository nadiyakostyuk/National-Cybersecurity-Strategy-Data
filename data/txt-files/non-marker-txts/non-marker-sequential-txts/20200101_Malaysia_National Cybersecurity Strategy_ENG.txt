MALAYSIA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2020-2024

INTRODUCTION




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

INTRODUCTION

Malaysia has been rapidly ushered into the digital age,
together with the rest of the world, for the past few decades
due to the exponential and unprecedented advancement
in the use of Information and Communications Technology
(ICT). We have come a long way since the first adoption of
the Internet back in 1995. Today, broadband connectivity
has become a necessity for businesses, services and citizens
of Malaysia to succeed and be relevant in the Fourth
Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Hardly any person or thing
is Unconnected to cyberspace. Businesses are becoming
deeply reliant on democratised technologies such as mobile,
social, Big Data, Internet of Things (loT), Artificial Intelligence
(Al), and hyper-scale cloud that are all dependant on this
connectivity.



Anything connected to the
internet is exposed to cyber risks.
With this in mind, Malaysia needs to
develop a cyber security strategy
that is pragmatic and aims for a
cyberspace that is secured, trusted
and resilient while at the same
time fostering economic prosperity
and the well-being of its citizens.
We believe that our vision can
be achieved by fortifying local
capabilities to predict, detect,
deter and respond to cyber threats
by strengthening our cyber security
governance, nurturing competent
people, supporting best practice
processes and deploying effective
technologies.

Information sharing platforms,
channels and avenues for
government agencies, businesses
and the general public on cyber
security and cyber threats need
to be enhanced. Our situational
awareness, coordination, and
threat mitigation capabilities
likewise must be improved.

We are indeed fast becoming a
digitalised nation. In 2018 there
are 28.7 million Internet users in
Malaysia which represent 87.4% of
the population. Such astounding
figures illustrates our growing
dependency and connectedness
to cyberspace. On the other side,
cyber-attacks have progressed just
as fast as, or even faster than the
security measures that were put

in place. Governments now have
to deal with cyber threats not just
aimed at personal and financial
gains, but also threats from state-
sponsored actors aimed at critical
targets of national importance. It is
worth noting that state-sponsored
attacks are not only sophisticated
and potent, but once deployed,
these advanced _ technologies
can fall into the hands of cyber-
criminals who can then amplify
the use of these powerful cyber-
weapons at global scale.

The targets of malicious
cyber activity are often the
very foundation of a_ nation.
Consequently Malaysia recognises
cyber security as a_ national
priority. This has led to the
formulation of the National Cyber
Security Policy (NCSP) in 2006. The
NCSP was specifically developed
to address the risks to the Critical
National Information Infrastructure
(CNII), which are made up of 10
sectors namely: National Defence
and Security; Banking and Finance;
Information and Communications;
Energy; Transportation; Water;
Health Services; Government;
Emergency Services; and Food
and Agriculture. The NCSP
recognises the critical and highly
interdependent nature of the CNII
and aims to develop and establish
a comprehensive programme and
a series of frameworks that will
ensure the effectiveness of cyber




| Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

security controls over vital assets,
as well as to ensure that the CNII
sectors are protected to a level
that commensurate with the risks
faced.

The establishment of the National
Cyber Security Agency (NACSA)

further reaffirmed the growing
importance of cyber issues to
Malaysia's national security.

NACSA is a dedicated agency that
oversees all national cyber security
functions formed under the aegis
of the National Security Council
(NSC). NACSA was established
as a response to the dynamic
nature, increasing sophistication,
global nature and heighten socio-
economic impact of cyber security
threats. It serves as the lead
agency that integrates the existing
cyber security capabilities. This
includes combating cybercrime
in a strategic and coordinated
manner — in partnership ~— with
the private sector and _ other
governments.

The efforts are ongoing to
assess the current legislative
framework for cybercrime issues
and cases. In order to adapt to
the ever-changing landscape of

cyberspace, existing laws need
to be enhanced to effectively
address the legal challenges

in taking action against cyber
criminals. The Attorney General's
Chambers (AGC) led the review

of the laws of Malaysia with a view
to enhance the existing legislative
and regulatory framework used
to combat cybercrime. The
amendments to certain laws are
now in progress, where the AGC
collaborates with law enforcement
agencies and _ other relevant
government bodies.

Furthermore, a national policy
and procedure in managing
cyber crises has been formulated
to ensure that cyber attacks
and cyber incidents are being
managed__ proactively through
a coordinated approach at the
national level. This initiative is
closely guided by the National
Security Council's Directive
No 24: Policy and Mechanism
of the National Cyber Crisis
Management, an executive
directive that outlines the
nation's strategy for ‘cyber crisis
mitigation and response’ through
public and private collaboration
and coordination. There are six
(6) main principles under _ this
directive namely national cyber
crisis management structure;
national cyber-threat levels;
Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT); cyber security
protection mechanisms; response,
communication and coordination
procedures; and a_ readiness
programme.




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

The government has also established
the National Cyber Coordination and
Command Centre (NC4), a centre that
deals with cyber threats and crises at the
national level. The NC4 was developed
under the purview of the NACSA as a
central coordination and command facility
responsible for managing cyber security
at the national level, including mitigation,
preparedness and response functions at a
strategic and tactical level. It is connected
to the entire main cyber security-operating
centre (SOC) in Malaysia namely MCMC
Network Security Centre, Government
Integrated Telecommunications Network
(GITN) SOC, Cyber Defence Operation
Centre (CDOC) and Cybersecurity Malaysia
SOC. It has the ability to determine the
national cyber security threat level and
assess the impact of the threats to the
country.

Malaysia has also implemented the initiative
to ensure the adoption and certification of
the CNIl agencies (public and private) to
the MS ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security
Management Systems standard and other
related certifications. This initiative is to
ensure the CNIl agencies and organisations
have the necessary information security
protection in place and are in compliance
with the. standard. Appropriate measures
will also be prepared to protect other non-
CNIl sectors such as the manufacturing,
construction, education and retail since
cyber threats and attacks in these sectors
also pose risks to the overall economic
wellbeing and security of the nation.




Another important cyber security
initiative that has been conducted
for the past decade is the National
Cyber Crisis Exercise (also known
as X-Maya). The exercise was
designed to test the effectiveness
of the procedures that have been
developed under the National
Cyber Crisis Management Plan
(NCCMP) and to. assess the

readiness and preparedness of
critical national infrastructure
agencies against cyber-attacks.

To date, six (6) national cyber crisis
exercises have been organised
with the participation from more
than. 100. public and private
agencies across the 10 CNils.

On another front,

Malaysia has
also. been actively creating
awareness and capacity building
programmes. Whilst the rapid of
ICT, bring benefits and advantages
to our citizen, it is also carries
tiskks to the nation’s
social harmony and __ security.
To manage such risks, public
awareness is crucial. Agencies

to coordinate these programmes,
NACSA is developing the National
Cyber Security Awareness Master

and effective programmes and
initiatives. Under this Master Plan,

It is crucial to acknowledge that
the security of cyberspace is
paramount, now more than ever.
In the past, we have seen how
the infrastructure of nations and
businesses were brought down with
significant financial implications.

This is not a far-fetched scenario for
Malaysia, especially if we refer to
the results of a study conducted by
Microsoft in collaboration with Frost
& Sullivan on Understanding the
Cybersecurity Threat Landscape
in Asia Pacific Securing the
Modern Enterprise in a_ Digital
World published in July 2018. The
study revealed that the potential
economic loss in Malaysia due
to cyber security incidents could
hit up to RMS51_ billion, which is
more than 4% of the total Gross
Domestic Product.

As the foundations of our economy
become increasingly rooted in
digital technologies, Malaysia will
model and promote standards
that protect our economic security
and reinforce the vitality of the
nation as a viable marketplace
and source of innovation. This
will include, among others, the
initiatives to promote local industry
in emerging technologies and 5G.

The Malaysia Cyber Security
Strategy (MCSS) has been
designed with tools to. provide
trust in our cyber environment
not only for national security, but

. @

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

also to support the government
agenda in the digital economy,
Industry 4.0 and the adoption
of other disruptive technologies
for Malaysia's advancement.
This Strategy will replace the
existing NCSP as it is developed
to be more inclusive and
comprehensive covering
protection of CNIl, businesses,
industries and also citizen. This
document includes specific
Pillars to define key areas of our
concern as well as the necessary
strategies for each of them. Each
strategy will in turn comprise
of a number of action plans
and measurement mechanisms
that will be implemented within
the effective period of _ this
document. Regardless of those
mechanisms we need to, we have
to realistically remind ourselves
that none of these strategies
will be effective in combating
cyber security issues without the
cooperation from all stakeholders.

Cyber threats are persistent
and there will always be the
risk of targeted cyberattacks of
massive scale and consequences.
Such threats can never truly be
eradicated as long as everything
stays connected. Yet, they can
be mitigated. For this to happen,
everyone will have’ to play
their role and work together to
enhance Malaysia's overall cyber
security readiness, capacity and
capabilities.

According to the Digital Crimes Unit of Microsoft Asia (January
2019), roughly 720 people become preys to cyber criminals all
over the world in every minute which translates to more than
1 million victims every day. In 2018, the Royal Malaysia Police
had to deal with 10,742 cybercrime cases with an estimated
loss amounting to almost RM400. million, while in 2019, the
number has increased to 11,875 cases with an estimated
loss to almost RM500 million. The numbers may.be shocking
to some but not if we consider the fact that cyber criminals

Malaysia is also a_ target of
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
attacks, with the most recent
incident manifested by way of
email spear phishing. These threats
can escalate further given that
many Malaysian — organisations
continue to operate a number of
legacy and unsupported systems,
which can no longer be updated
with the latest security patches.
These legacy systems may have
multiple vulnerabilities, which are

susceptible to attack payloads
and tools available to cyber
criminals.

There are also concerns about
the increasing number of content-
related issues in Malaysian
cyberspace. While these incidents
are relatively still small in number,
the impact on the nation is not.
Given the speedy and widespread
nature of the Internet as a medium
of delivery, the effects of content-
related issues are potentially
more detrimental and damaging.
For this reason, Internet-based
contents, in the form of fake news,
misinformation, contents that are
seditious and slanderous in nature,
or with racial or religious overtones,
are taken very seriously by the

government, while respecting the
right to freedom of speech.

As Malaysia continues to embrace
digital technologies, there is an
increasing need to streamline
the management of cybercrimes
and incidents to assure the public
that all cybercrimes and incidents
will be handled appropriately
and effectively by the respective
law enforcement agencies.
There is a need to eliminate
duplicative efforts and maximise
resource utilisation among the law
enforcement agencies.

One of the main reasons for the
establishment of NACSA was to
coordinate and complement all
efforts on cyber security to make
sure that all aspects are given
due attention. While focusing on
cyber security policy, governance
and coordination matters, NACSA
will also be administering other
areas of concern, which will be
mandated to specialised agencies.

Efforts concerning other
target areas, namely the CNII,
cybercrime, awareness, capacity
building and international
cooperation will be delegated to







selected groups of lead agencies,
law enforcement arms and
institutions that have the relevant
expertise and direct responsibility,
as well as the required capacity
and capability to deal with the
related issues and initiatives.

In Cyber Security Ecosystem,
NACSA will serve as the focal point
on all matters related to cyber
security that also spans vertically
to include other existing and
aligned national initiatives such
as the Digital Infrastructure, Digital
Trade, National Security, Digital
Malaysia and Digital Government.
NACSA serves as an entity that
is responsible for streamlining
all. cyber. security planning,
development and implementation.
To ensure the successful

implementation of the strategy,
an effective ecosystem and
governance, this Strategy will
outline the roles and responsibilities
of agencies involved in managing
national cyber security. — This
will be realised by legislating a
new National Security Council's
Directive, which will elucidate our
enhanced national cyber security
governance arrangements and
the restructuring of committees
directly responsible for national
cyber security, and delineating the
exact roles and responsibilities of
all relevant agencies.



ISSUESAND
CHALLENGES




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

ISSUES AND CHALLENGES

Due to the borderless nature of
cyber threats, it can be safely
assumed that any or all of them
can befall upon any nation. To
date, Internet-related fraud has
been the most prevalent cyber
threat in Malaysia. This is supported
by the cybercrime reports
received by Royal Malaysian
Police in 2018 and 2019 which
shows that telecommunication
fraud, e-commerce, 419 scam

(also known as Nigerian Scam) and
e-financial fraud are among the
most prominent threats. Such cases
have been known to cause huge
monetary losses to the victims. If
this trend is sustained, Malaysians
will project a greater concern in
doing business through an online
platform, which indirectly erodes
the consumers’ confidence in our
cyber security measures.



However, it is important to note
that lack of awareness is the main
factor in most of these fraud cases.
In phishing incidents, for example,
people can be easily duped by
bogus sites and services due to
their negligence. The same goes
for scams whereby unsuspecting
victims would transfer huge
amount of money to recipients
whom they have never met and
whose identity cannot be verified
- all done for the expectation of
an honest purchase, attractive
investments and even promises of
love.

On another alarming note, the
healthcare sector now has other
cyber threat concerns that are
even more’ worrying than the
attacks and.intrusions on electronic
medical records. Medical robotic
technology and _ robot-assisted
surgical procedures are now
connected to computer systems

and networks which expose
them to cyber threats. As the
patient records are digitised, the
risks of breach and disclosure of
confidential information are also
rampant.

Clearly, much has to be done
in terms of creating awareness
among the general public.
This would explain why cyber
security education will soon be
introduced even as early as
in primary education. Cyber
security awareness and education
aims to educate citizens from
making errors of judgement while
transacting on the Internet.

Aside from that, Malaysia is
also facing a shortage in_ its
cyber security workforce and
talent gaps in many sectors. In
today's constantly connected
and borderless world, such
inadequacy can be _ disastrous



22 | Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

to organisations. The shortage of
cyber security professionals will
leave organisations vulnerable and
exposed to untold dangers from
cyberspace.

Insider threats also remain a
significant cyber security risk to
organisations. Insiders with access
to critical information systems and
data pose a significant threats to
any organisations. There have been
numerous cases of intellectual
property theft and the leaking of
sensitive information that have
caused substantial financial and
reputational damage.

There were also incidents where
these insiders, either employees
or vendors, unknowingly became
victims of elaborate cybercrime
schemes such as through watering
hole attacks, social engineering
ploys, malware and ransomware
infections, propagation mechanism
by inserting infected USB devices
into the internal networks or
arbitrarily clicking on links found
in emails or while browsing the
Internet.

The government via its relevant
agencies and initiatives will
have to approach organisations
and _ institutions on best cyber
security practices. More efforts
have to be made to encourage




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 (ea

necessary controls over system
and data access by employees
and vendors. The implementation
of a proper Bring Your Own
Device (BYOD) policy should be
deployed by organisations and
institutions. Again, awareness also
plays an important role here in
mitigating incidents due to insider
threats, especially for those at the
management tier.

Additionally, the correct posture
and approach are needed in
dealing with the selection of
third parties/vendors, planning,
development and implementation
of ICT projects, especially those
that involve or intended for critical
establishments such as an Industrial
Control System (ICS) for CNIl
agency. Security-by-Design should
be the flagship approach in ICT
project development in order to
ensure that the end products and
systems are free of vulnerabilities
and not susceptible to cyber
threats. This can only be achieved
through continuous testing,
authentication safeguards and
adherence to best practices.

Malaysia has also been facing
threats of terrorism and violent
extremism. Terrorists and violent
extremists have been using various
web services and social media as
a breeding ground to entice new




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

to their causes. Continuous efforts
have been made to curb such
threats and there have been
successful convictions in recent
years. Yet the ease of developing
a new website or forum for any

agenda presents a _ growing
challenge to law’ enforcement
agencies.

These issues are complex due to
the varying interpretation of what
would and should be considered
as amounting to terrorism or
violent extremism. There has been
a dire need of manpower and
expertise to monitor and correctly
identify web contents that would
fall under this category. There are
also. other obstacles including
this content which is usually
hosted by providers that are
beyond our jurisdiction. The lack
of awareness among the general
public concerning these types of
resources reduces the incidents of
timely reporting of this content.

Content-related issues, on the
other hand, bring a new level
of complexity. to the’ challenges
of cyberspace. Some issues

G pornography
harmful content such as online
gambling, information on_ illegal
substances, instructions to make
firearms, and misleading and false
information, require a coordinated
and swift effort and commitment
by all parties, which in this case
would be agencies and institutions
that are directly responsible for
network accessibilities. Removal
or restriction of access to content
that is deemed as harmful by
Malaysian law must be pursued.

There is also the issue of differing
perspectives on content that
may be perceived as either
hate speech or seditious, or an
appropriate expression of free
speech. This is often the case for
politically-motivated postings on
blogs and social media. While
there have’ been — successful
convictions from time to time, the
creation and spreading of content
of this nature does not seem to
be lessening, and if anything, they
seem to flourish correspondingly
to the actual situation of the
counterpart issues in the real world.

levels of society. Citizens are now
more vigilant on how and what
personal information is shared.
The Personal Data Protection Act
2010 has also helped to clarify
what would be considered as
encroaching user privacy by
entities collecting user information.
Greater effort is needed to take
strong action against those that do
not act appropriately to protect
personal data.

On the technological side, threats
due to vulnerabilities and cyber-
attacks are consistently increasing.
This is very much due to lack of
awareness among. users, both
in| government institutions and
business entities; and among
individuals. Good cyber hygiene
habits - such as creating complex
passwords, consistently backing

Upgrading software and hardware,
and limiting privileged access to
critical systems - are still lacking
among public and private sector

that the prevailing issues and
challenges in Malaysia's cyber
security landscape can be
attributed to, first and foremost,
awareness and education.
Technological solutions and
controls can only do so much - it is
the netizens themselves that need
to have a basic grasp of cyber
security essentials and related
legislation and regulations so that
they can at least avoid the most
common pitfalls, particularly while
navigating cyberspace.

crucial for achieving Malaysia's
goals of protecting government
and CNIl networks, system and
data, as well as businesses and
citizens, while at the same time
combatting cybercrime.

Effective
Governance
and Management

Experience has taught Malaysia that the most important
measure to safeguard cyberspace is effective governance
and management. The management of cyber security risks
should evolve simultaneously with the evolution of threats,
alongside the adoption of digital in doing business. Ideally, we
need a national standard on governance and management,
which allows for shared responsibility and cross-sectional
integration to optimise the efforts in dealing with any issues,
threats or breaches.







Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

This Pillar aims to create effective governance and management through
three strategic initiatives, specifically by:

This Pillar aims to achieve the
ability to defend our networks,
data and systems from cyber
threats and subsequently respond
to threats effectively in a well-
coordinated and concerted
manner. Equally imperative _ is
the ability to predict and detect,
investigate and disrupt hostile
actions against the government,
businesses and citizens of Malaysia.
To achieve this, the government
shall play the crucial role of
ensuring that all action plans are
properly implemented by the
intended entities.

In order to enhance the national
cyber security governance
framework, we_ will © strengthen
governance structures by

clearly defining the roles and
responsibilities of all parties within
the ecosystem. This can be
accomplished by reviewing the
current roles and_ responsibilities
held by the existing cyber security
stakeholders in Malaysia.

Recognising the critical and
highly interdependent nature of
CNIl organisations from both the
government and private sectors
in managing cyber security risks
and_ incident responses, the
government will continue to clarify
the roles and responsibilities of
the respective organisations as
technologies evolve to ensure
the CNIl are protected to a level
that commensurates with the risks
faced.



We will also identify and bridge
gaps_ in responsibilities | and
coordination among agencies and
sector leads in managing incident
response by enhancing threat
information sharing platforms. At
present, there are various cyber
security stakeholders in Malaysia
in the form of law enforcement
agencies and other government
bodies with varying degrees of
roles, jurisdiction, competence
and functions in the cyber security
governance value chain. Agencies
such as the MCMC, MDEC and
CyberSecurity Malaysia focus on
regulating the communications
and multimedia industry, driving
the digital economy and providing

ICT security specialist services,
respectively. Others like the
Royal Malaysia Police and the

Central Bank of Malaysia lean
more towards law enforcement.
Whereas parent institutions such
as the Ministry of Communications
and Multimedia Malaysia and the
Ministry of International Trade and
Industry oversee the bigger picture
and implementation of policies.
For the purpose of improving the
national cyber security ecosystem,
all these resources must be pulled
together and work side by side
via a multi-agency coordination
protocol with streamlined
processes and procedures, and
a well-defined scope of .authority
and accountability.

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

To achieve this agenda, the
government has established
NACSA to serve as the central
agency for cyber security in
Malaysia. At the moment,
development and enhancement
efforts are now in place to
equip NACSA with the necessary
capabilities to provide leadership
and guidance to all cyber security
organisations that will fall under
its coordination. In this respect,
NACSA will be directly responsible
in overseeing the establishment
and operations of various
information sharing platforms
among the various stakeholders. It
will also be at the forefront in the
identification and management of
risks and vulnerabilities that are of
significance and concern to the
national cyber security ecosystem.
Subsequently, NACSA will be the
focal point for the implementation
of proactive measures to protect
the government and CNIl
agencies’ networks, systems
and data and to improve inter-
agency coordination to combat
cybercrime.

The NC4 will be the main hub of
all other Cyber Operation Centres
in Malaysia. NC4's capability
to predict, detect, deter and
respond will be further intensified,
strengthened and enhanced to
address cyber-security related
issues.



Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

Even though the government has
led many initiatives to improve the
current cyber security landscape,
it requires the cooperation and
collaboration of all stakeholders to
achieve the mission to secure our
cyberspace and provide a safer
environment for all Malaysians.
An embedded and sustainable
approach is needed whereby
citizens, industry and other partners
in the society and government,
play their full part in securing
the networks, services and data.
Therefore, efforts will also be taken
to enhance collaboration and

build trust among government
and CNIl agencies, businesses
and partners through information
sharing and Public-Private

Partnerships.

To facilitate this, we will provide
the engagement programmes
and information sharing platforms,
such as conducting conferences,
seminars, workshops and dialogues
where all the = stakeholders.

including Chief Executive Officers,
Chief Financial Officers, Chief
Information Officers, Chief Security
Officers and Chief Information
Security Officers could share
their knowledge, thoughts,
experiences and proposals. Such
collaboration would pave the way
for an appropriate and systematic
sharing mechanism and platform
on actionable cyber _ threat
information, enhancements _ of
cyber security coordination and
the promotion of analytical and
technical exchanges between
subject matter experts.

A change management plan
will also be prepared and
subsequently introduced to
organisations that are involved
to streamline changes and
improvements that are required
to be in place to support
the envisioned governance
structure. Also, in order to provide
the necessary mechanism
and structure for effective



coordination, information and
media management, we will be
working towards establishing the
National Communication Plan. This
Plan is necessary to describe the
requirements of an_ information
channel that is both capable
and quick to accommodate for
information sharing during a cyber
crisis or incident and will also serve
as the main reference to explain
the roles and responsibilities of all
related agencies with regards to
media management.

These are especially crucial given the
rapid advancements of the digital
age that foresee the expansions of
e-government initiatives, e-commerce
transactions and digital economy
in our daily lives. This is with the
inclusion of Artificial Intelligence
and machine learning in modern
systems, the increasing application
of loT in devices and peripherals,
and the extensive use of complex
Industrial Control Systems. All
of which inadvertently would
open up even more avenue for
potentials risks and threats to
security, safety and privacy.

In essence, Pillar 1 initiatives
will cover the protection § of
the CNIl sectors, with support
and guidance _ for businesses
and: individuals to mitigate
cyber threats. Recognising the
importance of digital economy,
the government will include
Trade, Industry and Economy as

. @

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

one of the CNIl sectors. Focus will
be made on the development
of sector specific guidelines and
frameworks, such as maritime and
aviation to accommodate current
cyber security needs and address
the emerging threats, with a key
attention on the convergence of
Information Technology (IT) and
Operational Technology (OT)
systems.

Hence, a government-led
Technical Working Group will be
established to spearhead an in-
depth study on laws, rules and
regulations as well as standards
and best practices in cyber
security that have to be adhered

to by the CNII agencies. The
government will also create
a_ training platform to assist

participating organisations in
complying with cyber security
standards.

The government will work together
with private sector entities to
promote understanding of cyber
security risks, encourage a more
informed risk management
decisions, and advocate
investments in appropriate security
measures. This will serve as an
effective platform of cooperation
between various’ public and
private sectors thus ensuring that
business entities and organisations,
as well as citizens, adopt the
security-centric norms, behaviour
and practices that are required to
stay safe in cyberspace.



Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

We will establish a data leakage
protection mechanism through the
adoption and_ implementation — of
policies, procedures and _ guidelines
related to data protection, public
key infrastructure and electronic
information management. This will be
realised through the development of
data leakage protection policy and
guidelines as well as the execution
of the National Cryptography Policy,
which outlines the methods and
strategic approach in the use and
creation of cryptographic algorithms
and cryptography products to protect
information that are of national interest.

Management of vendors that deal
with government and CNIl agencies
will also be improved to minimise data
privacy and security risks. Awareness
initiatives will be conducted on supply
chain threats. Supply chain security

management will be integrated
into agency procurement and _ risk
management process. Vendors,

products and services shall be assessed
to identify those with high risk and
mitigated accordingly. Third parties that
are awarded with government projects,
especially on ICT, will be required to
adhere to information security standards
and practices such as the International
Organization for Standardization and
the International Electrotechnical
Commission's ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and
ISOMEC 27002:2013 as well as. having
the necessary cyber security and
information security experts in place.



Management of the Computer
Emergency Response Teams
(CERTs) will also be improved

and strengthened through the
enhancement and restructuring of
National Cyber Security Incident
Response Team (CSIRT), Sector
CSIRT and Organisation CSIRT.
These CSIRTs will be provided with
the necessary capabilities and
capacity to handle, mitigate and
recover from cyber crisis and
incidents. Furthermore, cyber
incident reporting will be made
mandatory for all government and
CNIl agencies, while businesses will
be encouraged to report them.
We will also develop a Vulnerability
Assessment Implementation
Plan and conduct periodic risk
and vulnerability assessment on
all critical ICT services. We will

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

measure the National Readiness
Level through periodically-
conducted studies.

The government will draw on its
capabilities to develop and apply
active cyber defence measures
to enhance the levels of cyber
security readiness across national
and government networks. Cyber
security courses, content and
syllabuses will be developed for
government training programmes
and for specific target groups that
will be identified based on their
roles and responsibilities. All existing
training platforms will be utilised to
establish main training centres that
can cater for these target groups
and properly meet their needs
and requirements in capacity and
capability building efforts.



Cyber security incident
management will also be
enhanced through the revision
of the National Cyber Crisis
Management Plan (NCCMP) and
its reporting mechanism by the first
quarter of 2021. Cyber exercises
at the organisational, sectoral and
national levels will be implemented
according to the Cyber Exercise
Implementation Plan, of which
the findings will greatly contribute
to the preparation of the Cyber
Readiness Report, planned to be
delivered by end of 2021.

Combatting terrorists and violent
extremists’ use of the Internet will
continue to be a priority area,
with the main objectives of: raising
awareness among the public;
and preventing radicalisation and
terrorist recruitment and fund-
raising activities through digital
platforms. such .as social media
and web. portals. The Southeast
Asia Regional Centre for Counter-

Terrorism (SEARCCT) and the Royal
Malaysia Police will continue to
play their role in monitoring violent
extremist activities in cyberspace.
An integrated information sharing
platform shall be developed
to facilitate flow of information
between agencies and towards
the general public.

Ultimately, under this Pillar, it is
expected that a new _ national
cyber security governance
structure with a clear division of
power and responsibilities is built
based on the foundations and
principles set forth by the National
Security Council's Directive. The
implementation of the Malaysia
Cyber Security Strategy will be
supervised through an. annual
evaluation process, after which a
Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy
landscape report will be prepared
and presented to the stakeholders
for milestone reviews and further
deliberations.

Malaysia has a comprehensive set of cyber related laws
in South East Asia. Since the 1990s, Malaysia has introduced
numerous laws to cater for the advent of digital age and the
full spectrum of cyber issues.






46 | Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

The Computer Crimes Act 1997 was
enacted in 1997 to address crimes
directed at computers and ICTs.
This act covers offences such as
unauthorised access to computer
material and unauthorised
modification of computer contents.

As technology evolves at a
rapid pace, Malaysia recognises
that there are areas in the laws
which need to be reviewed to

The first order of this Pillar is to
study and review all the existing
laws and regulations that have
been used to deal with cybercrime
and cyber security cases. Findings
of said efforts will not only pave
the way for us to appropriately
update the existing legislation
and regulation but will also help
us introduce a new law in cyber
security, if deemed necessary.

accommodate new technologies
and to reflect new realities,
especially in the cyber security
domain. The emergence’ of
new cyber threats pose new
challenges. Consequently,
Malaysia may need to consider
mechanisms to enable existing
laws to be applied in cyberspace,
and, only if required, enact new
laws.

Malaysia is fully aware that
cybercrime requires a coordinated
and cooperative _ international
response. The cross-border nature
of cybercrime creates challenges
in bringing cyber criminals justice.
Recognising that effective regional
and _ international cooperation is
crucial in combating cybercrime,
Malaysia will continue enhancing
regional and_ international co-
operation through existing bilateral



and multilateral cooperation
platforms. Malaysia is also striving
to strengthen and _ harmonise
domestic legislation with
international conventions and
treaties.

Malaysia recognises that
the challenge’ presented’ by
cybercrime also requires a
coordinated and an_ integrated
national approach. Law
enforcement agencies need to
work together to address. the
threats. -Malaysia will be taking
steps to enhance the capacity
and capability of law enforcement
agencies to tackle cybercrime by
developing and implementing the

. @

National Cybercrime Enforcement
Plan (NCCEP). Under this Plan,
efforts will be taken to increase
the knowledge and skill of judiciary
members, prosecutors, law
enforcement officers and legal
practitioners so as to prepare them
for the intricacies of cybercrimes in
the digital era.

An expert group will also be
established to identify gaps
and required improvements
in cybercrime enforcement.

Furthermore, we also need
to foster better collaboration
between government agencies
and key stakeholders including
telecommunication companies,



48 | Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

industries, Internet service providers
as well as content providers both
at national and international levels.
Law enforcement agencies will be
equipped with the latest tools and
capability for the identification
of criminals / malicious parties;
and the identification, collection,
acquisition and preservation of
digital evidence. Digital forensic
labs will be enhanced to address
the growing complexity — of
cybercrime investigation.

We will also ensure that the
tools and technology, as well
as capability enhancements
for each law _— enforcement

agency are accredited, directly
related and the best available
to accommodate the type of
cybercrime cases that they
handle. A national working group
on capacity building and joint
collaboration with various training
institutions will be established in
order to develop specific modules
of training and the mechanisms
to assess the effectiveness of such
training.

The Plan also calls for a clear and
streamlined coordination process
among central and enforcement
agencies. For this purpose, a
Cybercrime Coordination Centre
will be established. The Centre will
focus on ensuring an. integrated

and coordinated approach in
addressing cybercrime.

This approach is timely since
fighting cybercrime requires
concerted efforts. In order to
achieve’ effective investigation
and successful prosecution of
cybercrime, a team of experts,
consisting of investigating officers
and forensic experts, should be

established at the initial stage
of the investigation to address
and advise on specific issues

arising during the investigation
process. The Centre will also
serve as a central information
sharing mechanism between law
enforcement agencies to increase
efficiency and to minimise delay in
investigation.

Such endeavours follows the
study on the requirements for
the establishment of more cyber
courts. The first cyber court was
established in September 2016,
and was aimed at addressing
the increasing number of civil
and criminal cyber cases. The
dedicated cyber court will ensure
that cyber cases receive priority
with adequate levels of expertise,
which will translate into efficiency
in disposal of cyber cases. The
government will .also » examine
the feasibility and _ viability. of
establishing a specific unit that

combines elements from all of the
agencies that
have been dealing with cyber security
cases and incidents under one roof
in order to streamline our actions and
reactions.

various government

A comprehensive Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) also needs to be
developed and endorsed to serve
as a guide for law enforcement
agencies in investigating cybercrime.
This is particularly important as
cybercrime have expanded _ well
beyond the virtual domains and now
even interconnected with other type
of criminal activities such as human
trafficking, drug smuggling and. illicit
recruitment whereby ICT tools are used
as an information, communication and
coordination platform.

Other than fostering collaborations
between local law’ enforcement
agencies, the Plan will also explore the
possibility of furthering cooperation
with foreign counterparts. This could
include cross-border secondments
or visiting experts’ programmes. It
is hoped that through these efforts,
more can be shared between like-
minded national agencies and experts
in dealing with cyber security issues
and challenges that are common to
all and borderless in nature.

Enhancing
Capacity and
Capability
Building,
Awareness and
Education

To meet the challenges of the rapidly changing nature of
cyber threats, the government will develop and implement
a comprehensive National Cyber Security Capacity and
Capability Plan that will determine the areas of expertise
and skill sets that will need to be continuously improved and
enhanced at national, sectoral and organisational levels.



Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

Correspondingly, this Pillar aims to enhance capacity and capability
building, awareness and education through three strategic initiatives,

specifically by:

The Plan will be implemented
by building coherent — cross-
sector collaboration in strategic
information sharing and security
awareness initiatives, deepening
the understanding of advanced
threats, developing a_ culture
that understands security risks in
the context of business resiliency
and expanding the capability to
develop a safer and more resilient
technology, as well as the ability to
respond to advanced threats.

Malaysia has been developing
and implementing cyber security
capacity and capability through
various ministries, agencies and
CNIl. organisations. Enhancements
of national cyber security
capacity .and capability will be
focused on increasing the number
of focal skilled professionals
through training and certification
programmes to meet the demands

for skilled workforce in both
the public and private sectors.
Specialist skill development, on the
other hand, requires pursuing good
quality and established security
professional certifications primarily
in specific areas of cyber security
domain, that are lacking in the
country.

Meanwhile, awareness and
education would require, among
other things, the identification of
necessary target audiences and
content development approaches
that can enable resource
sharing and collaboration. The
government, through its various
agencies, will take up the
crucial role of empowering all
levels of society to understand
cyber security-related risks
and ‘challenges, as well as the
necessary defensive measures
needed for safer Internet use.



64 | Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

The Malaysia Digital Economy
Corporation, the lead agency
for driving the digital economy in
Malaysia, will spearhead efforts to
increase the number of local skilled
professionals, which will include
talent development initiatives
through new talent, up-skilling and
re-skilling. The government will also
provide additional funding and
scholarships in order to encourage
knowledge acquisition and
enrichment among existing cyber
security professionals. This will help
develop a new generation of a
cyber security professionals, with
the necessary education and skills.

Currently, CyberSecurity Malaysia
has started its efforts to increase

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

These commendable initiatives at
the same time are experiencing
challenges in terms of resources,
coverage, approaches and
target groups that have
hindered the effectiveness of the
implementation.

To enhance Malaysia's approach
on cyber security awareness, the
government will develop and
implement the National Cyber
Security Awareness Master Plan.
Under the Plan, the National Cyber
Security Awareness Governance
structure will be established, which
aims to develop an_ integrated
and concerted cyber security
awareness programme. The primary
aim of the integrated programme
is to reduce the number of cyber
incidents by running cyber security
awareness programmes and call
for actions that are more organised,
coordinated and able to reach
a wider target audience among
Malaysians.

The Plan. will outline integrated
initiatives on public-private driven
collaboration and _ coordination,
and the mobilisation of resources



68 | Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

to enable a wider outreach
of programmes to kids, youth,
adults/parents and organisations.
Initiatives by various agencies
will also be implemented in an
integrated and coordinated
manner to ensure a_ wider
coverage and bigger impact. This
will be crucial to educating citizens
on the necessary knowledge to
detect and avoid abuse, fraud
and crime online, as well as to
nurture accountable behaviour,
thereby creating well-informed
and responsible cyber citizens.

At the same time, we will also be
working on establishing a creative
content development programme
mechanism that brings together
all the stakeholders, from both
the public and private sectors, to
share their experience and best
practices on creating awareness.
It is hoped that a_ unified
national brand of cyber security
awareness programme can
then be developed, one which
streamlines the content of various
awareness programmes based on
the accepted security baseline
framework. A corresponding

measurement mechanism will
also be appropriately devised to
evaluate the effectiveness of said
programmes and to identify ways
to improve them from time to time.

Cyber security will also become
part of the syllabi at the primary,
secondary and tertiary level of
education. Given the increasing
threats from cyberspace and
the all-embracing nature’ of
ICT and the Internet, especially
among the younger generation
of Malaysians, we believe that it is
never too early to introduce and
foster cyber security awareness.
Our youth needs to be equipped
with the necessary cyber security
knowledge and tools to ensure
safety and security.

In academia, there is a need
to embed cyber security
across taught courses under
ICT and Computer Engineering
programmes. As an _ example,
cyber security requirements
need to be taught in Software
Programming (secure coding),
Software and System Development
Cycle (Secure .SDLC), Database,




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

Operating Systems, Network, IT
Administration and Management,
as well as cross platform
application development. This
effort is in addition to the present
dedicated cyber security related
courses being taught in colleges
and universities.

The same effort of introducing
cyber security related issues
across non-ICT or non-Engineering
disciplines covering cyber law in
Law, FinTech in Finance, security
tisk management of network ready
medical devices in Health, among
others, is necessary to enable
graduates to stay relevant and
to be able to grasp the impact of
new technological developments.

Within the Public Service
Department, there is a need
to establish cyber security as a
vertical (grade) in the government
sector to enable specialisation in
the various domains under

information security and to

enable retention of these trained
personnel within their expertise by
providing sufficient opportunities
for career growth.
















Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

Strengthening
Global
Collaboration

ca

In the digital age, no nation or economy can remain in a silo
in combating cyber threats. Global collaborations, including
information and knowledge sharing, as well as international
cooperation and enforcement, are crucial to effectively
counter evolving cyber threats. The nature of the Internet —
which is ambiguous and anonymous — may contribute to the
misperception, misinterpretation and misrepresentation of
cyber threats or attacks, leading to potential escalation or
tension between states. As such, it is imperative to instil trust
and transparency between states through close international
cooperation on cyber issues.




International engagement is also
pivotal to combat cross-border
threats and attacks involving
multiple jurisdictions. Strong
international engagement plays
important roles in addressing the
challenge, particularly in expediting
cross-border enforcement activities.

Fostering global collaboration
is thus a key component of this
strategy. Malaysia needs to engage
with other trusted international
entities to strengthen cooperation
that is mutually beneficial, while

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 | 75

respecting state boundaries and
sovereignty.

While establishing or enhancing
cooperation will significantly
strengthen relationships, Malaysia
is also committed to adhering to
the international commitments
and obligations with regard to
cyber security (where appropriate),
be it at regional, sub-regional or
multilateral level. Malaysia also
recognises the need to build
capacity in cyber diplomacy.



Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

The primary element in
accomplishing the first strategic
initiative is through embedding
cyber security as a key priority
in our foreign policy. The
development of a cyber security
international engagement plan
will be the next step —- it will
enable Malaysia to enhance
and coordinate its international
engagement across government.
A dedicated working group will be
established to develop this plan.

Having a comprehensive \iiMt int vv
plan will only be beneficial if
the government machinery
responsible for implementation is
well equipped with appropriate
skills and knowledge. Hence, the
relevant government agencies will
work together to embed cyber
security as one of the elements in
our diplomatic and international
affairs capacity building
programme. The aim is to ensure
that our diplomats around the
globe have a clear understanding
of key cyber security issues and
knowledge of our national context.

Qu falseSwa




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

Malaysia will continue to foster
bilateral relations in cyber security
with other nations and identified
international organisations or
industry players through the
creation of official collaboration
instruments either by Memorandum
of Understandings, joint statements
or legal instruments. The efforts will
be followed through with practical
collaborations such as knowledge
sharing and transfers, joint R&D,
echnology transfers, information
exchange and_ training, policy
dialogues, jointly organised

interest of the respective fora in
collaboration with the identified
partners. Concurrently, we
will also promote international
collaboration in both the
public and private sectors, and
establish strategic alliances with

international cyber security fora as
well as conferences.

We will intensify our efforts to
disrupt the business model and
infrastructure of organised crime

through greater cross-border
collaboration. We will learn from
the successes and failures of
others in policing and enforcing
cyber security such as in dealing
with infringements of copyright,
computer-related fraud, child
pornography, online gambling
and violations of network security
to help improve cyber security
measures. Intelligence from trusted
international partners on_ issues
with implications to the nation,
especially on critical national
infrastructure, will be constantly
monitored and responded
to accordingly. Malaysia will
also engage the _ international
platforms, primarily in international
standards development and
ratification of treaties, to ensure
that any new international cyber
security norms being developed
does not contradict our national
interest.

CONCLUSION




Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

Malaysia has committed to providing a cyberspace that is
secure, trusted and resilient, and also encourages economic
prosperity and supports social well-being. We are confident
that this can be accomplished by strengthening our
capabilities to predict, detect, deter and respond to cyber
threats.




In the face of constantly changing
cyber threats, Malaysia needs to
be prepared, more than ever,
to protect its national security
and sovereignty. Although the
global community agrees on the
importance of cyber threats, there
are still continuing discussions at
the regional and _ international
levels as to how to effectively
combat them. There will always
be questions on how far a nation
can or should go in responding to
what it perceives as a threat to its
national security and sovereignty,
and the complexities surrounding
such a situation when the cyber
incidents are cross-border in
nature.

The Malaysian government will
strive to meet its responsibilities
and lead the national response;
however, businesses, organisations
and individual citizens ~— also
have to play their roles and
take reasonable cyber hygiene
measures to protect themselves
and ensure that they are cyber
resilient and able to continue

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 | 85

operating in the event of a cyber
incident.

NACSA will play its part in providing
cyber security guidance and
coordination while keeping pace
with existing and emerging cyber
threats and the development
of new technologies. All the
necessary steps will be taken to
ensure ease of access and sharing
of threat information among
government entities, businesses
and the general public. NACSA
will also provide advice on the
risks and the actions necessary to
mitigate them.

However, the effort to develop
such competencies has _ to
be supported by a_ structured
governance that provides the
means, funding and __ facility
required to cultivate a competent
workforce, maintain the
appropriate standards, policies
and best practices, and implement
the most effective approach and
solutions to address cyber security
issues.



86 | Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024

The main duty of the government
is and will always be to defend the
nation, its economy and prosperity
as well as its citizens from threat
and harm by internal and external
factors, be it from cyberspace or
otherwise. It is therefore pertinent
for Malaysia to set the rules,
standards and expectations over
all elements and entities under
its control and responsibility in
order to ensure a safe and secure
cyberspace; and to collaborate
with trusted parties from the
international community that share
the same objective and aspiration.

For all these to be realised, there
has to be a sense of inclusiveness,
first and foremost, among all the
stakeholders at the national level.
Securing the national cyberspace
will indeed require a collective
effort. All roles and functions within
the cyber security ecosystem
that are outlined by the strategies
are eventually connected
and _ interdependent with one
another, which clearly show that
cooperation will always be a key
aspect in ensuring success, security
and peace.

To support the national interest,
Malaysia needs a_e class of
competency, capability and
awareness that can truly safeguard
the national cyberspace, its
critical sectors, businesses and
most importantly the well-being of
its citizens, not only from external
threats but also those from within.
It is also important to highlight that
while we will always uphold the
right to a free cyberspace, we also
acknowledge that constraints and
controls are still needed at some
levels of access and provision to
ensure that our intrinsic values as a
multi-racial nation and society are
protected and kept intact.

In the long run, this can significantly
assist in ensuring uniformity in the
adoption and _ implementation
of standards, policies and
guidelines among all cyber security
stakeholders in Malaysia. Again,
we should remind ourselves that
any strategy or planning will only
be as good as the people behind
it. Therefore, for the next five years,
everybody must pull together or
face the risk of getting left behind
in the digital era.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

In the journey of the development of the Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy
(MCSS), an extensive deliberations, engagements and dialogues with a range
of stakeholders has been carried out to gather inputs, feedbacks and insight
from their point of view. A series of workshops, seminars and conferences has
been conducted which involved government ministries and agencies, CNIl
agencies, enforcement agencies, industry, businesses, academia, non-gov-
ernment organisations as well as the public.

On the other hand, Academy of Sciences Malaysia (ASM) has conducted an
exercise to understand the issues and challenges that affect the national in-
frastructures, businesses and the well-being of citizens, as well as to identify the
gaps in cyber security in Malaysia. As a result, ASM has produce an advisory
report which outline the relevant strategies and specific recommendations to-
wards ensuring a safe and secure national cyber environment. The advisory
report also being used as a reference in developing the Malaysia Cyber Secu-
rity Strategy.

On that note, the Government would like to express an appreciation to every-
one for their commitment, contribution and efforts towards the completion of

mt

MCSS.
