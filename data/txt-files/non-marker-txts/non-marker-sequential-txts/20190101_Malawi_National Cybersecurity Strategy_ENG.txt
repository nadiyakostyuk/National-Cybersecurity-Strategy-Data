FOREWORD
Information Communications Technology (ICT) has become a critical driver for socio-economic 
development, with the deployment and adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy 
improvements in all aspects of life and institutional operations in the nation. Improvements in 
telecommunications infrastructure in Malawi has contributed to the ever increasing over-all 
adoption of ICTs thereby contributing to an emerging digitally enabled society. Furthermore, the 
Malawi Government recognizes the significance of ICT to achieving inclusive and sustainable 
growth and development. It is against this background that the Malawi Growth and Development 
Strategy (MGDS) identifies ICT as one of its key pillars among the priority sectors for economic 
growth. In addition, Government has put in place further instruments such as National ICT Policy 
(2013), National ICT Masterplan (2014), The Electronic and Cybersecurity Act (2016) to enable 
inclusive growth of the sector.
The recent deployment of a nationwide fiber-optic network infrastructure further underscores 
the commitment that the Government has to ensure interconnectivity.  Such developments 
provide a plethora of opportunities to the once “unserved peripheral communities” to join the 
bandwagon of the digital world and effectively take part in the global ICT revolution. The public 
and private sectors have embraced technology at the center of their business leveraging improved 
availability of higher capacities of bandwidth and better ICT innovations. Innovations in ICT 
contribute to efficient service provisioning, enable e-commerce and enhanced collaboration to 
curb geographical barriers in knowledge transfer and sharing of ideas.
However, a number of risks and threats exist or have emerged in the cyber space. The threats 
range from mere real time hacking of systems, phishing, mobile money fraud, organised online 
human trafficking, child pornography, bullying among other threats perpetrated over the internet. 
These restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the socio-
economic development of the nation. 
The Government is committed to keep the nation safe from cyber threats. I therefore call upon all 
stakeholders in the sector to join hands in the implementation of this Strategy.

PREFACE
This National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2019 – 2024 aims to provide a national framework 
for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in 
cyberspace by Malawians. This has been achieved by describing the high level Strategic Goals and 
Specific Objectives that provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, 
and establishes the Actions that need to be taken for each. It is a bold and ambitious approach to 
tackling the many threats our country faces in cyberspace. The Government recognizes its special 
responsibility to lead the national efforts in managing and mitigating cyber threats. 
The Strategy defines Malawi’s cybersecurity vision, key objectives, and ongoing commitment 
to support national priorities by encouraging ICT growth while aggressively protecting critical 
information infrastructures. Government is committed to the safety, security, and prosperity of 
our nation and its partners. In order to achieve this, cybersecurity is a key component in providing 
organizations and citizens with confidence in online and mobile transactions. Furthermore, 
foreign investment will be greatly encouraged and a broader set of trade opportunities within the 
global marketplace will be opened. Successful implementation of the Strategy will further enable 
Malawi to achieve its economic and societal goals. 
The formulation of this Strategy followed a participatory process that involved various 
stakeholders, including Government, private sector, the academia, development partners and the 
general public. As such, Government will also rely on these partners to implement this Strategy 
in the most efficient and effective way possible.
The Government is committed to ensuring that the commitments set out in this Strategy are carried 
out and accurately monitored and regular reports are produced. As a Ministry responsible for 
ICTs, we are determined to see this Strategy implemented. I, therefore, call upon all stakeholders 
to work with Government to achieve the goals that have been set in this Strategy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Communication services in Malawi have been governed by the Communications Act (1998) 
which was developed during the era of second generation (2G) technologies. Malawi has seen 
the growth of access and usage of ICT services, including an increasing number of online 
transactions for services. The increasing demand for the ICT applications and services coupled 
with the provision of high-capacity fibre backbone connectivity across the nation has resulted in 
the creation of substantial opportunities for further growth in the ICT sector. It is also expected 
that these developments will drive significant socio-economic growth in Malawi. Consequently, 
and in an effort to create a conducive environment for the sustained growth and use of ICTs in 
Malawi, as well as address the threats that come with increased adoption of ICTs, the Government 
of Malawi undertook a review of existing legislation and developed the   Communications Act 
(2016) and the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016).
ICT has become a critical driver for socio-economic development, with the deployment and 
adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy improvements in all aspects of lives 
and institutional operations in the nation. However, a number of risks and threats exist or have 
emerged that restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the 
socio-economic development of the nation. This Strategy aims to provide a national framework 
for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in 
cyberspace by Malawians, by describing the high level strategic goals and specific objectives that 
provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, and establishes actions 
that need to be taken.   
Chapter 1 of the Strategy provides an introduction to cybersecurity in Malawi while chapter 2 
details the guiding principles upon which the Strategy is built on, and which will underpin the 
implementation of the Strategy. Chapter 3 outlines the core components of the National Strategy 
including the vision   mission statement, high-level strategic goals and specific objectives. It 
further describes the various actions necessary for achieving the Specific objectives and strategic 
goals of the strategy. Chapter 4 describes the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders 
in the implementation of the strategy and further proposes an approach for monitoring and 
evaluating the implementation of the strategy. The implementation logical frameworks for the 
strategy which provide details on Deliverables, Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Timeframes, 
Lead Organisations and Funding options are described in the Appendix.
This Strategy therefore outlines the Government of Malawi’s approach to ensuring a safe and 
secure cyberspace that can be fully leveraged by citizens and institutions. Consequently, driving 
further growth of the ICT sector, as well as socio-economic development across Malawi.

1.	 INTRODUCTION
1.1.	 Background
Major reforms in the ICT Sector of Malawi go as far back as the 1990s with the advent
of sector liberalisation through the separation and commercialisation of the then
incumbent Telecommunications operator, Malawi Posts and Telecommunications
 Corporation (MPTC) into the Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) and Malawi Posts
Corporation (MPC). Subsequent major reforms include the implementation of the
Communications Sector Policy (1998) and the Communications Act (1998) that led to the
establishment of the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA). Due to
advances in technology over the years, the Communications Act (1998) was reviewed in
2016 and also the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) were enacted.
These are the two current legislations for the sector.
Currently, the mobile penetration rate in Malawi is quite low in comparison to the average 
African penetration rates, highlighting the tremendous potential for further growth in 
Malawi. Currently, the mobile penetration rate is at 45 percent compared to the African 
region average of 77.8 percent. The broadband access prices in Malawi are among the 
highest in the region due to high cost and limited availability of international bandwidth. 
However, the internet sector has about 50 licensed ISPs out of which only 20% are active. 
The mobile penetration and broadband are expected to grow exponentially over the next 
couple of years. Since, the current mobile market in Malawi is a duopoly, the Government 
of Malawi has introduced a converged licensing regime in an effort to encourage further 
market competition and growth. It is expected that the converged licensing regimes 
will introduce new entrants into the sector and enhance competition resulting in lower 
prices.  In addition, service providers in Malawi have launched 3G services, invested in 
LTE infrastructure or continued to extend their WIMAX wireless broadband networks. 
Furthermore, Malawi gained access to international submarine cables recently following 
the completion of a transit link via neighbouring countries and is currently deploying a 
national fibre backbone. 
As a result of these recent developments within the sector, as well as the high potential 
for further rapid proliferation of ICTs within Malawi, it is evident that Malawians 
will increasingly get connected to the Internet and use ICTs overtime. This increased 
connectivity and use of ICT’s come with increased threats to activities of businesses and 
people in Malawi. If Malawi is to fully leverage ICTs to spur socio-economic development 
of the nation, it has to be ready and capable of addressing these threats. 
1

NCS 2019-2024 sets out a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring Malawians can access 
and use cyberspace with trust and confidence, and ensuring the nation responds to threats 
to ICT systems and services in a coherent and effective manner. 
1.2.	 Situational  Analysis
1.2.1. National Development and the Role of ICT 
The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III) recognizes how critical a 
well-developed ICT system is in the development of Malawi. Currently, ICT contributes 
about 5 percent to the country’s GDP while the sector’s growth rate is at 6.4 percent. 
The telecom sector accounts for 95 percent of the ICT sector employment and revenue. 
The Government embarked on implementing a number of strategies resulting in a number 
of desired outcomes including improved ICT broadband infrastructure; increased access 
and usage to ICT services; improved postal and broadcasting services; improved ICT 
governance; and enhanced ICT capacity for the general public. This is consistent with the 
Government’s current overarching Policy Goal for ICTs in Malawi, as described within 
the National ICT Policy (2013) which is “to contribute to socio-economic development 
through maximum integration of ICT in all sectors and the provision of ICT services to the 
rural areas”.  
The development of the MGDS follows a phased approach to address the ICT development 
needs of the country in support of the prevailing policies and the legal framework. The 
MGDS was developed to be the overarching operational medium-term strategy for 
Malawi in the attainment of its set vision. The main thrust of the  MGDS  is to create 
wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means 
of achieving poverty reduction. The MGDS I was developed to lay the framework while 
MGDS II was tasked with putting in place the operational mechanism. The NCS therefore 
builds on initiatives implemented in MGDS II as well as feed into MGDS III thereby 
addressing Government goals of universal ICT access within a safe and secure operational 
environment.
This policy direction is quite consistent with global research studies and evidence that 
clearly demonstrates the connection between ICT adoption and usage of ICT services with 
national GDP growth. In fact, the World Bank has demonstrated the greater development 
impact of broadband specifically on emerging economies as compared to high-income 
countries. Currently, Malawi’s broadband penetration has risen from 6% in 2013 to 
around 17.1% in 2016, which is relatively low compared to other Southern African 
2

Development Community (SADC) countries and the rest of the world. However, with the 
rapid development of the ICT sector, the Government of Malawi through the MGDS III, 
recognizes the potential broadband growth which puts the users of ICT services at a cyber 
risk. Thus, the Government of Malawi needs to be prepared and deploy effective strategies 
or measures to create a conducive environment that builds trust and confidence in the use 
of ICTs by Malawian businesses and citizens. 
1.2.2.	Cybersecurity in Malawi
Understanding the current cybersecurity-related activities of Malawi is critical to ensuring 
the effective cooperation between Malawi’s stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related 
mandates and activities. Therefore, this Strategy considers the various functions and 
activities of the different stakeholders in Malawi relating to cybersecurity. Noteworthy 
cybersecurity-related activities undertaken in Malawi over the past year include the recent 
approval of the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) and the development 
of this National Cybersecurity Strategy.  The recently promulgated Electronic Transactions 
and Cyber ecurity Act (2016) address a number of ICT security issues like cybercrime, 
data protection, and privacy among others. For instance, the Electronic-Transactions and 
Cybersecurity Act (2016) will enable citizens to undertake various electronic transactions 
with the full protection of the law, as well as ensure citizens are protected from computer 
related harms like cybercrimes, viruses and hacks. Part 6 of the Electronic-Transactions 
and Cyber Security Act (2016) provides details of offences; Clause 87, for instance, 
addresses events where an individual knowingly introduces or spreads a software code 
that damages computer, computer system or network.  Other issues addressed in the Act 
include cryptography, Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD), the establishment of the 
Malawi National CERT and the appointment of cyber inspectors. 
However, efforts to address challenges within the cyberspace in Malawi were fragmented 
due to the absence of a coordinated strategic approach by all key stakeholders. This Strategy 
will therefore provide a link among all these stakeholders to provide effective solutions to 
the identified challenges. The NCS as an overarching strategy provides a platform for: the 
Ministry of Justice to deal with the legal issues related to the cyberspace in conjunction 
with all law enforcement agencies; the regulatory authorities to review the effectiveness 
of the legal and regulatory framework; and the academia to review the curricula and offer 
training suited to the trends in addressing challenges in the cyberspace. 
The extent of cybersecurity issues entails generic actions to specific sectors that eventually 
feeds into the national strategy. For instance the banking sector has embarked on sector 
3

specific training to address the needs of the banks, likewise the academia has also 
incorporated various courses for cybersecurity in order to enhance the level of knowledge 
and awareness for cybersecurity.
1.2.3.	Cybercrime in Malawi
The high levels of ICT access and usage in the country coupled with the absence of specific 
legislation dealing with cybersecurity issues in Malawi is a big challenge in the fight 
against common forms of cybercrime. The Government’s position on cybercrime, like 
other nations across the world, continues to be a real threat and facet of life in Malawi. 
Cyber criminals continue to commit cybercrimes of larger scales and sophistication across 
various countries. Many of these cyber criminals seek to make use of confidential and 
sensitive information and usually have detrimental effects on individuals, businesses 
and Government institutions. Consistent with global trends, a major sector targeted by 
cyber criminals in Malawi is the financial sector. Other notable cybercrime incidents that 
have been observed in the country include and not limited to child pornography, sexual 
harassment, fraud, forgery, crime recorded, mobile money fraud, Government Websites 
defacement, identity theft, email scams, distribution of compromising images, attacks on 
computer data and systems. 
In the National ICT Policy (2013), the Government set out to establish sufficient national 
capacity to deal with national security, the violation of human rights, and the undesirable 
impacts of ICTs. Furthermore, the enactment of the Electronic Transactions & Cyber 
Security Act (2016) has provided a platform to harness all the efforts that were being 
hampered by lack of appropriate legislation. Malawi is also benefiting from regional 
initiatives and harmonization of strategies to provide a model standard for the region.
Therefore, it is critical that Malawi develops a Strategy that protects its citizens and institutions 
from these cyber criminals and enhances the nation’s ability to detect, prosecute and prevent 
cybercrimes.    
1.2.4.	Linkages with other National Policies and Programmes
The National Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with and will complement the following 
key strategic documents:
●	 The National ICT Policy (2013) - The policy recognizes that Malawi needs to establish 
adequate capacity to deal with undesirable impacts of ICTs including the violation of

6.	 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (CSFS)
The CMM that was used to assess cybersecurity posture of Malawi revealed a number of critical 
success factors that will lead to successful achievement of cybersecurity goals of Malawi. These 
factors include:
6.1.	 Political Will
●	 Enhancing Malawi’s cybersecurity posture needs to be a top priority for the Government.
●	 Cybersecurity requires adequate organizational and political support.
●	 At the national level, cybersecurity has to be driven from the highest office to provide a 
unified agenda that will guide all relevant national stakeholders. 
●	 At organization level, the success of cybersecurity efforts depend mainly on the 
commitment and support of top management to get stakeholders support and secure 
budget for cybersecurity.
●	  security governance should be led by competent security managers 
6.2.	 Funding and Resources
●	 The successful implementation of Malawi’s NCS will depend on adequate funds and 
resources. Considering that ICTs and Cyberspace spur socio-economic growth, the 
National Cybersecurity Strategy implementation logical frameworks have identified 
possible lead organization and funding sources for various measures proposed in the NCS. 
6.3.	 Effective coordination of efforts
●	 Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among different players with different 
responsibilities and abilities requiring unified coordination across a wide spectrum of 
stakeholders. 
●	 Successful implementation of the NCS will therefore, require developing a comprehensive 
national structure that will facilitate national cohesion at all levels and meaningful 
participation by all stakeholders, working together toward a common goal of securing 
Malawi’s cyberspace.
6.4.	 Awareness, education and training
●	 The success of cybersecurity depends on availability of the requisite knowledge, 
awareness, trust to use information systems and reduced exposure to risks. 
●	 It is important to inform, educate and raise awareness of public and private organizations, 
owners of critical infrastructures and the civil society of their security responsibilities.
●	 Security awareness among ICT professionals and users can prevent them from becoming 
easy and soft target for cyber criminals. It is also important for the nation to provide 
qualified human resources with enhanced technological capabilities of dealing with 
24

complex challenges of cybersecurity. 
6.5.	 Collaboration and networking
●	 The world today is highly linked and interdependent as such cybersecurity requires close 
cooperation and collaboration among national, regional and international partners, based 
on mutual trust.
●	 Effective response to challenges of cyberspace security requires a networked approach 
among stakeholders in various fields to facilitate information and resource sharing.
6.6.	 Protection of Critical information infrastructure
●	 ICT infrastructure supporting critical societal functions must be secure, robust and 
reliable so that adverse incidents are avoided or mitigated as much as possible.
6.7.	 Innovation, Research & Development
●	 Cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and gravity requiring new solutions 
and approaches. Research and Development will provide a platform for innovation and 
creativity to deal with emerging issues in cyberspace.
25

7.	 MONITORING AND EVALUATION
The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will enable the assessment of the operational issues 
encountered during the implementation of the strategy, as well as the assessment of the long-
term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on periodic reviews. The Monitoring and 
Evaluation Plan will also provide mechanisms or tools for data collection and reporting, and 
further information on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and frequency of reports.
The implementation of the NCS will require a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that:
▪	
Supports the attainment of the NCS Vision and Strategic Goals; and
▪	
Enables accurate reporting on progress and identification of lessons learned and challenges 
encountered for informed decision making and effective planning. 
This can be used to elaborate new measures as well as amend and tailor existing initiatives under 
the strategy.  This section of the Strategy details the proposed systematic approach to monitoring 
and evaluating progress as an integral part in implementing the NCS of Malawi. The monitoring 
is scheduled to be periodic in order to track the progress of implementation of the NCS. The 
monitoring will, therefore, focus on periodic and objective assessment of progress towards the 
attainment of the set objectives. 
The key objectives of the monitoring and evaluation approach are:
●	 Establishment of Performance Targets for various Government institutions or relevant 
stakeholders responsible for implementing specific actions of the NCS. 
●	 Development of performance plans to establish a shared understanding of the expected end 
results, the approach to achieving these end results and identify the resources necessary 
to ensure a successful implementation. The plans will be based on the KPIs, Performance 
Targets and Deadlines provided in the Implementation Logical Framework 
●	 Monitoring and reporting performance and progress in achieving expected end results by 
identifying and promptly reporting observed or likely deviations. 
●	 Periodically evaluating institutional or individual performance against established 
performance targets
26

7.1.	 Monitoring
Implementation of this Strategy will be through annual work plans and budgets. The 
tasks detailed in the NCS implementation plan will form the basis for preparing annual 
work plans and budgets. In this regard, the Ministry of Information and Communications 
Technology and all relevant stakeholders will ensure that annual work plans and budgets 
are prepared within the framework of the Strategy. 
Activities of this strategy will be continuously monitored and monthly performance reports 
will be prepared by all implementing agencies and submitted to MoICT. The Ministry 
will in turn submit to the National Steering Committee quarterly performance reports 
highlighting the progress made towards the achievement of key performance indicators 
(KPIs) in general and quarterly targets. Furthermore, quarterly monitoring exercises will be 
conducted. Lastly, a comprehensive annual progress report will be produced highlighting 
the progress made towards achievement of the KPIs in general and annual targets. The 
purpose of periodic reporting is to account for the resources utilized and output/results.
 
7.2.	 Joint Annual Reviews
The MICECT in conjunction with other stakeholders shall set the Terms of Reference for 
the Joint Annual Reviews (JARs). The JARs will start at organizational level, sector and 
national level in order to allow for wider participation and analysis of implementation 
bottlenecks. Participation at national level will include representatives from all ICT 
stakeholders, who will discuss policy recommendations from the organizations as well as 
sector and achieved Annual Implementation Plan milestones. Emphasis will be placed on 
challenges being experienced in the achievement of the targets and how these can best be 
addressed.
7.3.	 Evaluation
Performance evaluation is very important as it helps in objective comparison of actual 
against expected results and the resultant impact. In a changing environment, some of the 
key assumptions in the strategy may dramatically change and affect implementation of 
the set outcome targets. It is in the course of evaluation that the effects of such changes 
will be determined and appropriate corrective action taken. The evaluations, therefore, 
will assess the relevance of the strategic goals and objectives, efficiency and effectiveness 
of the strategies, assumptions, the strengths and weaknesses in the implementation of the 
NCS. 
27

A mid-term and full review will be conducted. As such, an independent stakeholder will be 
commissioned to undertake the mid-term and long- term review of the strategy to determine 
the short and long-term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on annual reviews, and 
if necessary effect remedial actions following the mid-term review to keep implementation 
on track. The mid-term review will be undertaken at the end of 3rd Quarter of Year 3 of the 
Strategy and the long term review at the end of the 5th year.
