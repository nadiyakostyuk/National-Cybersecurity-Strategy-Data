Foreword


Norway is one of the leading digital nations in the world. As politicians, we have a responsibility 
to ensure that we make the most of the resources invested in our society. We are encouraging 
both the public and the private sector to participate in digital innovation, to improve efficiency, 
increase competitiveness and create new jobs.
The digitalisation of Norwegian society also represents a challenge. Digital infrastructure and 
systems are becoming increasingly complex, comprehensive and integrated. Dependencies 
and vulnerabilities are progressively emerging across areas of responsibility, sectors and 
nations, and it is generally expected that digital services should be accessible anywhere and 
all times. Successful digitalisation also includes making sure that the solutions provided 
appropriately accommodate demands for the security and privacy of the individual, and that 
everyone can be confident that the digital services will function as they should.
The first national Norwegian cyber security strategy was introduced in 2003, making Norway 
one of the first countries in the world to have a national strategy in this particular area. In step 
with developments in the threat landscape, the national strategy was revised in 2007 and 2012.
The Committee on Digital Vulnerabilities in Society published its report on digital vulnerability 
in Norwegian society in 2015. As a part of the follow-up on the report, the first white paper to 
the Norwegian Parliament that focused exclusively on cyber security was prepared in 2017. 
The paper was entitled “Cyber security – a joint responsibility” – and with good reason, given that 
we all share an interest in, and a responsibility for, securing our digital assets. What was once a 
topic of interest to a select few has now become an issue that affects each and every one of us.
The present strategy is Norway’s fourth cyber security strategy, and is intended to address 
the challenges that will inevitably arise in conjunction with the rapid and far-reaching 
digitalisation of Norwegian society. The developments in relation to previous national 
strategies are based on the need to reinforce public-private, civilian-military and international 
cooperations. The primary target groups for the strategy are authorities and companies 
in both public and private sectors, including the municipalities. Moreover, the strategy is 
to lay the foundations for ensuring private individuals have the necessary knowledge and 
understanding of risks in order to use technology in a safe and secure manner.
In preparing the strategy, we placed particular emphasis on applying an open and inclusive 
process so as to involve stakeholders from the public and private sector alike. A strategy 
conference involving more than 300 delegates, written input and high participation in a range 
of workshops clearly indicates there is great interest in identifying shared solutions. I extend 
my gratitude to everyone who has made a contribution during the strategy process.
The time has now come to make a start on the most important work – the follow-up. I hope 
that you will take ownership of the new national cyber security strategy, put it on the agenda 
and help ensure its implementation. By responding to cyber security challenges appropriately, 
we can make the very most of the digitalisation of society and benefit from new opportunities 
for us as individuals, as companies and as a society.

1   INTRODUCTION
1.1  Challenges
Technology will give rise to far-reaching changes over 
the coming years. Robotisation, sensor technology, 3D 
printing, big data and artificial intelligence are all examples 
of technological advances that are likely to change society. 
We will have access to digital services we can barely 
imagine – services that will be available 24/7, wherever we 
may be. Our everyday life will become increasingly digital, 
primarily to the benefit of private individuals, companies 
and the authorities.
The digitalisation carries with it a range of challenges. 
Our society is becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber 
threats, and thorough understanding of society’s digital 
dependencies is becoming ever-more important. Digital 
infrastructures and systems are growing more complex, 
global and integrated. All kinds of devices are being 
connected to the internet and use of cloud solutions is on 
the rise. The need to reduce costs and increase access to 
competence is resulting in more and more digital services 
being outsourced to third parties, particularly in low-
cost countries. Compound (hybrid) threats are blurring 
the traditional dividing line between peace and armed 
conflict, and challenging the conventional placement of 
responsibility between the civilian and military sectors.
The sheer speed of technological evolution makes it 
extremely difficult to forecast which threats will come to 
dominate the threat landscape of the future. Regardless, it 
is likely that specific types of threats such as ransomware, 
industrial espionage, sabotage, blackmail, cyber-bullying 
and identity theft will remain prominent over the coming 
years. These are threats that can be targeted at private 
individuals and companies alike, with severe consequences 
for those affected.
The Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) 
publishes an annual report entitled the “Comprehensive 
Cyber Security Risk Assessment” (Helhetlig IKT-risikobilde). 
The report is built on a comprehensive portfolio of risk 
and vulnerability reports from authorities, the business 
community, academia and other stakeholders. The 
assessment for 2018 suggests that the digitalisation of 
society is changing the value of both new and existing 
digital solutions. Every time services are digitalised or 
automated, the level of digital dependency in society 
increases. When services are made available on digital 
platforms, the associated values are exposed to threat 
agents operating in the domain. This naturally generates 
new security challenges and alters the threat landscape.
The threat landscape is characterised by the continuation 
of trends from previous years, combined with a 
reinforcement of some developments. Foreign intelligence 
activity targeted at public and private companies, along 
with cyber crime, constitute the predominant cyber threats 
to Norwegian society in 2018.
1.2  Strategy 
The Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security is 
responsible for coordinating public security in the civilian 
sector. The Ministry holds a special responsibility for 
national cyber security in the civilian sector, and will outline 
the Government’s policy for cyber security, including 
national cyber security requirements and recommendations 
for public and private companies.1 The Norwegian Ministry 
of Defence holds responsibility for cyber security in the 
defence sector. In order to address these responsibilities, 
the authorities have access to a broad range of tools: 
development of regulations and knowledge, supervisory 
activities as well as counselling and guidance.
However, the authorities will not be able to solve all 
challenges in cyberspace by themselves. Critical societal 
functions and other Norwegian interests are dependent 
on digital infrastructures that continue to increase in both 
scope and complexity. Long and less transparent digital 
value chains, which span multiple sectors and borders, are 
a core challenge in assessing digital vulnerability. 
The cyber security challenges must therefore be 
resolved by placing a strong emphasis on collaboration 
and partnerships among relevant stakeholders at both 
national and international level. Challenges need to be 
addressed through joint input and across traditional 
sectoral boundaries, such that the security needs of all 
stakeholders are appropriately accommodated. Particular 
emphasis must be put on cooperations and partnerships 
within the prioritised areas of the strategy. These are 
described in detail in Chapter 3.
1	 Cyber security has to do with protecting “everything” that is vulnerable 
because it is connected to or otherwise dependent on information and 
communication technology. The term is used synonymously with the terms 
“ICT security” and “digital security”.
1  Introduction

National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway   |  7
INTRODUCTION   1
1.3  Vision
In Norway, it is safe to use digital services. Private 
individuals and companies have confidence in national 
security, and trust that the welfare and democratic rights 
of the individual are being safeguarded in a digitalised 
society.
1.4  Strategic goals
This strategy places emphasis on our working together to 
reinforce cyber security in society. Based on the current 
security challenges, the following strategic goals are 
considered fundamental:
1.	 Norwegian companies digitalise in a secure and 
trustworthy manner, and are able to protect themselves 
against cyber incidents
2.	 Critical societal functions are supported by a robust and 
reliable digital infrastructure
3.	 Improved cyber security competence is aligned with the 
needs of society
4.	 Society has improved ability to detect and handle cyber 
attacks
5.	 The police have strengthened their ability to prevent 
and combat cyber crime


A STRONGER COOPERATION   2
There are several governmental bodies with a cross-
sectoral responsibility for cyber security (see Appendix 
A). It is important to ensure a good cooperation among 
these actors. One key collaborative hub is the Joint Cyber 
Coordination Centre (Felles cyberkoordineringssenter 
– FCKS), which comprises representatives from NSM, 
the Norwegian Intelligence Service, the Norwegian 
Police Security Service (PST) and the National Criminal 
Investigation Service (Kripos). The purpose of FCKS is 
to help improve the national capability to detect and 
withstand serious cyber attacks, provide strategic analysis 
and maintain a comprehensive threat and risk assessment 
for cyberspace.
The authorities cannot achieve good cyber security on their 
own. The business community has the requisite skills and 
resources and functions as a driving force for digitalisation 
and innovation. As such, it has a key role to play in the 
solution. In order to protect the digital society, private 
individuals, companies, sectors and nations must all look 
beyond the boundaries of their own interests. All companies 
have a responsibility to ensure their own cyber security, 
but the dependency of society on digital solutions makes it 
essential to establish stronger cooperations and partnerships 
both at international level and in all areas of society.

2.1  Public-private partnership 
Digital services and products are often developed by private 
companies or research and development communities.
A substantial part of Norway’s critical digital infrastructure is 
owned and operated by private companies. Consequently, 
important decisions related to the development of – and 
security in – cyberspace are made by commercial, non-state 
actors, i.e. outside the conventional intergovernmental 
arenas. As a result, the role of the authorities in the 
development of cyberspace is limited, which in turn calls 
for an extensive public-private partnership.
Public and private companies have different capacities, 
knowledge and skills, which supplement one another. The 
authorities have an important role as legislator, facilitator 
and supervisory body; law enforcement have designated 
powers to investigate and prosecute cyber crime. Moreover, 
the authorities also has the duty to collect foreign and 
domestic intelligence, collaboration within international 
bodies and share information about potential threats.
Increased collaboration inevitably leads to better 
situational awareness and better decisions, as well as 
allowing greater access to resources. In order to tackle 
ever-changing security challenges, cooperations should be 
intensified and developed even further.
Guiding principles:
••
The authorities and the business community work 
together to identify and discuss cyber security 
challenges, and to exchange experience about them.
••
This cooperation should carry obligations for both 
parties and be based on transparency, trust and 
mutuality.
••
The authorities contribute to establishing a business 
community where cyber security services are in 
demand, developed and provided.
••
When building up national capacity in cyber security, is 
should be facilitated for inclusion of capabilities from 
the business community.
2.2  Civilian-military collaboration
The defence sector is dependent on civilian digital 
infrastructures and services. As a result, cyber security 
challenges in the civilian sector are also of significance to 
Norway’s ability to handle security-political crises and to 
carry out military operations. In a worst-case scenario, 
cyber attacks on civilian infrastructures may challenge 
Norway’s ability to safeguard national security.
The total defence concept encompasses both military 
support for civilian society and civilian support for the 
Armed Forces. The contribution of the Armed Forces to 
public security also translates into improved ability to 
safeguard state security, given that a well-functioning 
civilian society and robust public security form an 
important foundation for well-functioning military defence. 
In order to meet common cyber security challenges, 
military and civilian actors must work more closely 
together. This includes conducting exercises in how to 
handle crisis situations, development of joint competence, 
mutual incident notification, and exchanging information 
about threats and vulnerabilities.
2  A stronger cooperation
National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway   |  9

10   |  National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway
2   A STRONGER COOPERATION
NATO is putting civilian emergency preparedness and 
civilian-military collaboration on the agenda to a much 
greater extent than previously. Emergency preparedness, 
crisis management and robust critical societal functions 
constitute a precondition for the overall preparedness and 
defence of the individual country – and thus of the alliance. 
Guiding principles:
••
Civilian support of the Norwegian Armed Forces in the 
event of cyber security challenges in times of crisis and 
armed conflict is provided within the framework of the 
total defence concept.
••
Companies in the defence sector work with civilian 
counterparts to identify, exchange experience about 
and find solutions to cyber security challenges that 
may be of significance to the ability to carry out military 
operations.
••
Companies in the defence sector and the civilian sector 
should make use of each other’s capacities to address 
common cyber security challenges.
••
Companies in the defence sector share information and 
experience with their counterparts in the civilian sector 
in order to raise the level of national security.

2.3  International cooperation 
Norway’s international cyber policy is to serve Norwegian 
interests, ensure robust and predictable framework 
conditions, and contribute to preventing and protecting 
against cyber vulnerabilities and threats. The governing 
document is the “International Cyber Strategy for Norway” 
(Internasjonal Cyberstrategi for Norge), published by the 
government in August 2017. The strategy clearly states 
that a sustainable global internet is dependent on finding 
an appropriate balance between transparency, security, 
robustness and freedom.
Digitalisation has changed the global digital landscape 
in just a short time. Digital value chains span national 
borders, and mutual dependencies are being established 
that challenge the control of the national authorities. At 
the same time, cyber crime and cyber attacks from both 
state and non-state actors constitute extremely serious 
threats to national security and economy. In order to 
achieve the best possible protection, it is essential for 
Norway to participate in international arenas to reinforce 
cyber security at global level.
Guiding principles: 
••
The authorities work with other nations to reinforce 
Norwegian ability to prevent, detect, alert and handle 
cyber incidents.
••
The authorities promote international cooperations 
on cyber security, agreements on state behaviour in 
cyberspace, and collaboration on combating cyber 
crime in international arenas such as the UN, NATO, 
the EU, the OECD and the OSCE. In addition, dialogue is 
established with other states bilaterally and at regional 
level, including Nordic collaboration.
••
The authorities ensure active Norwegian participation 
in relevant international arenas so as to ensure the 
internet remains an open, accessible, secure and 
robust platform, based on international standards 
and collaboration between authorities, the business 
community, academia and other parts of civilian society.
••
The authorities ensure close coordination between 
bodies that represent Norway in arenas where 
international cyber security policy and cooperation 
on cyber crime and handling cyber incidents are 
developed.

From a national perspective, it is important to ensure a 
comprehensive approach to cyber security challenges, 
irrespective of whether these take the form of intentional 
(e.g. cyber attacks) or unintentional (e.g. natural disasters, 
technological errors or accidents) cyber incidents. We can 
achieve comprehensive protection against cyber incidents 
through the interaction between the preventive measures, 
a robust digital infrastructure, the ability to deal with cyber 
attacks, the fight against cyber crime, and sufficient cyber 
security competence.
The digitalisation of society increases the importance 
of cyber security, given that robust cyber security is a 
particularly important precondition for maintaining trust 
and confidence in ICT systems and digital services provided 
by the public sector. A digital public sector contributes to 
increased efficiency, innovation and economic growth.
This strategy is supported by a two-part list of measures. 
Part 1 describes the authorities’ selected key measures 
related to the prioritised areas described in this chapter, 
while Part 2 presents ten basic measures for improving 
companies’ own ability to protect themselves against cyber 
incidents.
3  Prioritised areas
PRIORITISED AREAS   3


National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway   |  13
Subsidiary goals:
1.	 Companies take a risk-based approach to cyber 
incidents and use recognised frameworks, standards 
and management systems for cyber security.
2.	 The public sector exercises strong management and 
control of its cyber security. The companies’ cyber 
security management systems underpin their primary 
function and contribute to ensuring that cyber security 
incidents in one company do not cause serious damage 
to others.
3.	 Private individuals, the business community and the 
public administration have confidence that public digital 
services are secure and reliable.
4.	 The authorities and the business community share 
information about threats, vulnerabilities, incidents and 
efficient measures with relevant actors to make society 
better able to withstand cyber incidents.
5.	 The authorities share advice, recommendations and 
guidelines on cyber security to provide companies with 
knowledge for their security work.
6.	 The authorities act as a driving force for cyber security 
in digital consumer services and products.
7.	 The authorities establish conditions conducive to 
cooperations within the public sector and between 
public and private sectors.
8.	 The population has good judgement on cyber-related 
issues and a good cyber security culture.
3.1  Preventive cyber security
Strategic goal:
Norwegian companies digitalise in a secure and trustworthy 
manner, and are able to protect themselves against cyber 
incidents.
Cyber security is primarily a responsibility at company 
level. Corporate managers are responsible for conducting 
risk assessments and then, on the basis of these, 
implementing appropriate measures. The authorities are 
to provide conditions that enable companies to protect 
themselves against cyber incidents in order to uphold their 
own security and to increase the robustness of society 
as a whole. Preventive cyber security and a systematic 
approach to address risk will help reduce the possibility 
of cyber incidents having negative consequences for 
businesses, private individuals, or society as a whole. 
Prioritised advice and recommendations better enable 
companies and private individuals to initiate appropriate 
measures to increase the level of security in society. Part 
2 of the list of measures is therefore a key resource to 
increase companies’ own ability to protect themselves 
against and handle cyber incidents.
Preventive cyber security in society entails ensuring that 
digital services and products are secure and reliable from 
the moment of creation, and throughout their lifespan.

START-UP TIPS
START-UP TIPS
Establish sufficient systematics for security 
management, and make sure that an expert 
in the field supports the management in this 
work.
Upgrade hardware and software. Eliminate 
unnecessary complexity and unused 
functionality. Block the running of non-
authorised programs.
Include cyber security in the work on risk at 
the company. Establish clear responsibility 
at the company, with effective reporting 
lines to the senior management and board 
of directors.
Install security updates as soon as possible. 
Protect wireless networks with strong 
security mechanisms. Plan and document 
changes. Switch on logging, and review 
important logs regularly.
Prepare a list of the company’s key goals, 
the values and value chains involved, where 
key data are stored, and who has access to 
these data.
Use the latest version of your internet browser. 
Protect email with DMARC. Encrypt important 
information when it is stored on portable 
media and when it is sent via the internet.
Map the companies security culture and 
identify what can be improved. Define 
the desired culture and carry out adapted 
annual training programmes to promote 
appropriate security culture.
Change standard passwords and do not 
grant administrator rights to end users. Use 
2-factor authentication or, as a minimum, 
strong passwords.
Focus on expertise in procurement and 
implement risk assessment that is deployed 
among the management.
Establish an emergency response plan for 
different types of incidents, and run drills to 
test the plan.

PRIORITISED AREAS   3

3.2  Cyber security in critical societal 
functions 
Strategic goal:
Critical societal functions are supported by a robust and 
reliable digital infrastructure.
Society is dependent on critical societal functions being 
maintained, and this requires the digital infrastructures 
that support them to work everywhere and at all times.2 
Mutual dependencies across digital infrastructures 
represent a particular challenge. This applies in particular 
to the power grid and electronic communications 
networks, which constitute fundamental infrastructure for 
almost all digital infrastructures. An incident occurring in 
one digital infrastructure may generate negative impact 
on another. Companies should therefore be aware of 
which services they themselves are dependent on, and 
what potential consequences incidents in their own digital 
infrastructure may have on others.
2	 This strategy also includes critical social functions beyond what is covered by 
the Security Act. This can be functions that fulfil the fundamental needs of 
society and the population’s sense of security (banking and financial services, 
health services and the like). See DSB’s report “Society’s critical functions” for 
an overview of these.
Subsidiary goals:
1.	 The authorities ensure that frameworks and methods 
for identifying critical digital infrastructure are in place 
and provide guidance to make sure that critical digital 
infrastructures are identified.
2.	 Public and private companies that own critical digital 
infrastructure perform risk assessments to identify 
vulnerabilities and mutual dependencies between 
infrastructures so as to ensure comprehensive securing 
of digital value chains.
3.	 The authorities maintain an overview of critical national 
digital infrastructure.
4.	 The authorities define security requirements for 
critical digital infrastructure, provide guidance and 
conduct audits to ensure security requirements are 
met. Public and private companies that own critical 
digital infrastructure implement measures that ensure 
appropriate security in these.
5.	 Public and private companies participate in contingency 
exercises related to critical digital infrastructure.


National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway   |  17
3.3  Competence
Strategic goal:
Improved cyber security competence is aligned with the 
needs of society.
Competence and knowledge about threats, vulnerabilities 
and effective measures constitute a precondition for the 
ability to protect digital values against cyber incidents. This 
requires that everyone – private individuals, companies 
and the authorities – have access to information about 
cyber security challenges and the appropriate measures to 
address them. Specialisation within cyber security of vital 
importance to national security is to be accorded special 
priority.
The national strategy for cyber security competence (2019) 
elaborates the competence goals in this strategy and sets 
out conditions for a long-term build-up of competence, 
encompassing national capacity in the fields of research, 
development, education and measures designed to raise 
awareness in the business community and among the 
general public.
Subsidiary goals:
1.	 Provide attractive and competent research 
environments for prominent researchers and 
postgraduates.
2.	 The number of specialists within the field of cyber 
security covers the needs in the labour market and 
accommodates national security considerations.
3.	 Cyber security competence is sufficiently addressed 
in study programmes where ICT constitutes a key 
component, including ICT and technology courses. In 
addition, study programmes within other disciplines 
that include significant ICT elements also include cyber 
security to a relevant extent.
4.	 Good post- and supplementary education in ICT and 
cyber security at vocational colleges, universities and 
university colleges.
5.	 Cyber security is included in relevant professional 
training courses and vocational courses to a sufficient 
extent.
6.	 Pupils and apprentices have digital skills, including 
competence in secure use and security, that enable 
them to experience life skills and to succeed in further 
education, working life and participation in society.
7.	 Private individuals have knowledge and skills that 
provide them with good judgement concerning digital 
issues, and which contribute to protecting their privacy 
and assets online.
PRIORITISED AREAS   3


National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway   |  19
3.4  Detect and handle cyber attacks 
Strategic goal:
Society has improved ability to detect and handle cyber 
attacks.
Cyber attacks can constitute a threat to critical national 
functions, the security of society in general and Norwegian 
sovereignty. The ability to withstand cyber attacks in order 
to ensure freedom of action has become a key element of 
our national defence. Threat agents may be other states, 
non-state groups or private legal entities. The possible 
objectives of cyber attacks span a broad spectrum: 
from crime for profit to state-sponsored espionage, 
sabotage and hybrid operations. Cyber attacks can 
interrupt, influence and obstruct national decision-making 
processes.
The use of cyber capacities has increasingly become an 
integrated part of military operations. Depending on 
conditions such as the purpose and legitimacy of the 
attack, its strength and consequences, a cyber attack may 
be considered an “armed attack” – in which case it triggers 
a nation’s right to self-defence (see Article 51 in the UN 
Charter).
Norwegian emergency preparedness follows the principle 
of responsibility, in that whoever is responsible for an 
organisation under normal condition is also responsible 
in a crisis situation. The authorities will improve national 
preparedness and the ability to detect and handle cyber 
attacks. To do this, roles and responsibilities must be 
defined, and relevant stakeholders must have a good 
understanding of the situation and consequences. There 
must be adequate coordination, collaboration and sharing 
of information between the key actors responsible for 
identifying and dealing with serious cyber attacks. See 
section 3.5 about police responsibility.
Subsidiary goals:
1.	 Norwegian companies take responsibility for handling 
cyber attacks targeted at their own business and for 
sharing information about these with the authorities 
and other relevant actors.
2.	 The authorities continue developing frameworks that 
define roles, responsibility and governance structures 
for handling serious cyber attacks.
3.	 The authorities have improved capacity to assist with 
and coordinate measures to counter cyber attacks.
4.	 The authorities facilitate the sharing of information and 
transfer of experience between relevant parties with 
the purpose of detecting and countering serious cyber 
attacks.
5.	 The authorities continue developing international 
collaboration to increase national ability to prevent, 
detect, alert, attribute and counter serious cyber 
attacks.3
6.	 The authorities facilitate national exercises and 
establish conditions for Norway to participate in 
international exercises.
3	 In this context “attribute” is taken to mean identifying the actor or actors 
responsible for a cyber attack.

3.5  Prevent and combat cyber crime
Strategic goal:
The police have strengthened their ability to prevent and 
combat cyber crime.
The police are able to protect society and prevent, detect, 
investigate and prosecute crime. This task is the same in 
cyberspace as in the physical world. The rapidly advancing 
technological development creates significant challenges 
for combating cyber crime. The police are faced with new 
demands in their work due to the current threats, e.g. 
regarding access to new technology, need for specialist 
skills and collaboration with other actors.
It is essential that the population trusts that all types 
of crime is handled responsibly and effectively. The 
authorities will improve the conditions for the police 
to carry out their tasks in line with technological 
developments and crime trends.
PRIORITISED AREAS   3
Subsidiary goals:
1.	 The police have strengthened their competence and 
capacity to prevent and combat cyber crime.
2.	 Society trusts the ability of the police to prevent and 
combat cyber crime.
