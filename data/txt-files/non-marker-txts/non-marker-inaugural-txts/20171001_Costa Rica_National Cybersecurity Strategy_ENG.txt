Executive Summary 
 
 
The concept of Cybersecurity has evolved since the dawn of the first computers until today; the 
greatest challenge is securing the data, systems and processes safeguarded in them and 
shared through data networks such as the Internet. 
 
Already in 1961 appear the first articles on the creation of a global data network, and for 
1980 the Internet network presentation is performed, based on two IP protocols (Internet 
Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). This being the beginning of the network as 
such, later the WWW (World Wide Web - 1991) services were added. 
 
Every technological advance implies a security challenge, from avoiding data theft from 
computers, action applied directly to them, or else with the global data networks, avoid non-
authorized accesses and malicious with the purpose of extracting data and using them for 
unethical ends. 
 
The world does not stop; innovation and constant discovery are essential to the technological 
industry’s survival and for the growth of people. 
 
Governments are affected by different kinds of attacks and intentions; from the simple game of 
a youth experimenting and challenging the system, to the clear intention of harming a country’s 
systems and infrastructure. 
 
Today we are a village; as such we face powerful challenges; from the perspective of securing 
the world’s people data to the protection of the values enshrined in the universal declaration of 
human rights. 
 
Human beings’ intelligence is always proactive, searches new solutions, seeks new paths; this 
is not unfamiliar to hackers, who from their perspective it’s a challenge to undermine different 
bodies in order to obtain a personal achievement, an economic gratification or else contribute 
with governments and enterprises in the espionage of facilities and infrastructures. 
 
But these attacks must be repelled, with intelligence and coordinated actions so that society, as 
we are structuring it today, is not prey of a few, who for fun or consciously are determined to 
infringe it.

It is for this reason that this strategy and initiatives of having a safer world shall have great 
benefits in the future, since our people shall grow in confidence and acceptance of the diverse 
ways of thinking and action, important to attain a concert of nations. 
 
In our country, coordinating among the different sectors, searching for solutions to new issues 
required the cooperation of all. This document is only a first step in that search for knowledge; 
it’s a strategy which as such sets the guideline to follow hereafter in matters of cybersecurity in 
our country, mainly glimpsing the challenges we must conquer.

Chapter 1- Introduction 
 
At world level it is acknowledged that digital technologies and the information and 
communication technologies (ICT) in particular are catalyzers of economic, social and cultural 
development, since they facilitate access to immeasurable resources; and besides 
communication, they promote innovation, efficiency, transparency and economic prosperity of 
countries. 
 
Aware of that Costa Rica has opted for a strong promotion of the use of ICT, to enhance national 
development, strengthening the valid regulatory framework, to promote the development and use 
of telecommunications/ICT services within the framework of the information and knowledge 
society and to support sectors such as health, citizen security, education, culture, commerce and 
electronic government. 
 
Similarly, public policy has been aimed at fostering the incorporation of digital technologies, in 
public as private services alike, improving the efficiency of those rendering these services a n d 
searching to lo wer costs for those receiving them. Additionally, it enhances investment in the 
telecommunications sector, with a legal framework establishing in their principles the 
guarantee of transparency, non-discrimination, equity, legal security, technological neutrality, 
and training of human resources in the area of ICT. 
 
The results of these actions are reflected in the improvement of the national indicators for 
access and use of technologies. Moreover, in the international map, Costa Rica continues to 
grow in the international classifications based on its development. According to the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) on its 2014-2015 report, the country shows a very steady profile based 
on its tradition assets despite suffering from some persistent weaknesses. It has been reported 
that the country is well-positioned to participate in a quick transition to knowledge-based 
activities. The country has one of the best educational systems of Latin America and the 
Caribbean (the 21st position). The report also notes Costa Rica has a high assimilation of ICT 
(45th position) with a high capacity of International Internet bandwidth (36th position); many 
mobile broadband subscriptions (20th position); and developed innovative capacity (36th 
position) and solid access to technology (39th position), owing to the relevant role of foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and technology transfer (5th position) in the country.1 
 
However, with the high rates of Internet connectivity and access to ICT, as well as the 
generation and massive storage of sensitive data, arise risks and vulnerabilities exposing people, 
the corporate sector and the government too. Users who access the net with illicit purposes have 
taken advantage of this reality. Proof of this the increasingly sophisticated means to hide their  

MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
- 10 - 
www.micitt.go.cr 
 
 
 
Identity and conceal their cybernetic attacks, which hampers recognition, as well as the timely 
collection of probative elements of the crime, which limits due process by the corresponding 
authorities. 
 
The advantages offered by digital technologies, for example cloud services, are also exposed to 
attackers, since public clouds are not only more vulnerable targets, but are also virtually 
unlimited and anonymous network resources for attackers. 
 
Therefore, there is an evident need to develop and implement specific solutions to the risks and 
special vulnerabilities of the ICT, which evolve on a daily basis. Facing this reality and to be 
able to respond in a prompt and diligent way, the collaboration and cooperation of different 
national and international player is required. 
 
A decisive step towards the exploitation of digital technologies would be defining a strategy, 
including actions pertaining to security from a holistic perspective, which takes into account all 
the elements, including identification of risks and threats that could result and their possible 
prevention mechanisms, the adequate attention of incidents and implementation of corresponding 
corrective processes. 
 
The attention of incidents and cyber-attacks requires flexibility and speed in the development 
of an articulate national response, considering the existing frameworks and processes. For this 
reason, a series of elements have been considered, integrated in a strategy, seeking to increase 
cybernetic resilience, the development of the required human and technological resources, the 
strengthening of specialized response teams, national and international cooperation to enable 
exchange of information and the investigation of the informatics crimes.

as well as the protection of freedom of expression and Internet privacy as the central principle of 
cybernetic security. 
 
The National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes a joint and articulated effort among all the 
country’s sectors, to be able to guarantee that the established objectives are balanced, effective 
and in agreement to the national reality, defining the general principles which will set the 
standards in this matter.

Chapter 2 – Construction of the strategy 
 
Cybernetic security requires a holistic vision and multi-sectorial attention; so, in the process of 
construction of this strategy, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications 
(MICITT) had the specialized technical support of the Organization of American States (OAS) 
and enabled participation of the stakeholders to contribute in the development of this topic in the 
country. 
 
The construction process was headed by MICITT; starting on the month of March of 2015 
carried out three panel discussions, guided by OAS’ specialized staff, four sectorial workshops 
and two online consultations. 
 
On these encounters a participatory, open methodology was used with representatives of all 
sectors; presentations were made of OAS design structure, as well as proposals for 
approaching MICITT’s vision; then, participants shared their vision and points of view about the 
principles, objectives and priority lines of action to be included in the strategy according to Costa 
Rica’s reality. 
 
Based on these discussions the participants’ recommendations were extracted and a final draft 
elaborated, document exposed in the discussion panel, at the disposal of all everyone invited to 
the different workshops for 14 days, starting on June 21st of 2016 until July 04 of 2016 for 
reviewing and receiving comments and suggestions.

After this stage, the corresponding observations of form and content were incorporated with the 
purpose of achieving a solid and consensual document; it was submitted to review by OAS’ 
specialists. 
 
Finally, on June 05 of 2017, it was submitted to non-binding Public Consultation 
through the Official Diary La Gaceta N. 105 process from which this document was obtained. 
 
For the committed hard work done, we thank each one of the persons depositing their vast 
knowledge to the service of an instrument which shall be the roadmap in Cybersecurity matters 
for the coming years.

Chapter 3 – Current context 
 
3.1.1 The impact of ICT on economic development 
 
The use of the Internet has revolutionized people’s way of interacting and of these with the 
outside world. Connectivity is a priority for countries today since it gives access to a platform 
allowing the collaboration, innovation and promoting different interaction mechanisms in the 
economic, political and social fields. 
 
According to data from the International Telecommunications Union, “Measuring the 
Information Society, 2015” (ITU) the proportion of the world’s population covered by mobile and 
cellular networks is now over 95 %, while the number of mobile cellular subscriptions has 
increased from 2 .200 million in 2005 to 7.100 million in 
2015”.2

The growing use of telecommunications and ICT has been parallel to a considerable increase of 
users exposed to criminal activities and risks related to data security, as well as equipment’s 
intrusion and interruption. 
 
According to the Cybersecurity Report 2016 issued by OAS and the Inter-American Development 
Bank, “… cybercrime has a world cost of up to US$575,000 million per year; this represents 
0.5% of global GDP”3. Meanwhile, the same report indicates that for Latin America and the 
Caribbean, this type of crimes has an approximate cost of US$90,000 million per year4. 
 
Furthermore, the Connectivity Index or, Networked Readiness Index (NRI)5 from the World 
Economic Forum, 2016, Costa Rica is at position 44 only surpassed by Chile (38th position) and 
Uruguay (43th position) of Latin American countries. 
 
In addition, Costa Rica heads the exports of  value-added services in Latin America, which 
includes: telecommunications, information and other services. The foregoing represents 6.8% of 
GDP according to 2015 statistics, Honduras in second place (1.5% of GDP)6. 
 
According to data presented on the National Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators 
Report, Costa Rica 2014 “The weight of ICT exports as regards export of the country’s total 
goods, shows this sector is highly important. The 2006- 2014 period, it represented over 41% 
and in 2014, 56.6%, of the country’s total exports.”7

For 2015, the data show 39% of households had fixed Internet connection and mobile reached 
101% so it’s highly important adopting the necessary measures so the country is prepared for 
possible attacks and users know the risks, and actions to be taken to protect their data in the 
cyberspace, especially because the country is making efforts to expand networks throughout the 
territory; it is expected  that with the network deployment financed with resources from the 
National Telecommunications Fund (FONATEL), all the population will have access to the 
technologies.

With the impending growth of broadband networks and the use of and utilization of ICT, the 
exposure of sensitive data is tangible as is the risk of the networks to possible cybernetic 
attacks. 
 
3.2 
ICT and cybersecurity: national planning perspective 
 
Information and Communication Technologies are considered as invaluable tools for the 
country’s development; evidence is the increase of access, use and appropriation indexes for 
these. In that sense, the Costa Rican State has tried to incentive the incorporation of ICT and 
Internet connectivity in every field of national life; this is reflected on national planning through its 
planning instruments. The foregoing shows the importance of mentioning the contents of some 
of these instruments on the matter. 
 
 
3.2.1   Document “Costa Rica 2030: National Development Objectives” 
 
 
The document sets the country’s development objectives with a long-term vision; at the same 
time promotes cross-sectional collaboration and exchange of information. It establishes that 
development of ICT plays a supporting role in many dimensions, including economic growth, 
social and cultural investment, and infrastructure. O n “Economic Dimension” includes t h e  
topic of infrastructure indicating that “… infrastructure (roads, ports, airports, schools, high 
schools, clinics, hospitals, EBAIS, power services, water supply, management of solid waste, 
telecommunications services, community infrastructure, etc.) constitute a support and 
inescapable condition to achieve sustained high growth rates” 8 . Among the objectives it 
highlights: “Guarantee telecommunications with diversity of services, coverage to every town in 
the country”. This objective is to guarantee universal Internet access through incremental 
increases of connectivity at the national level9.

generate quality employment; 2) combat poverty and reduction of inequality and 3) an open, 
transparent, efficient government, in frontal assault against corruption. In this plan 
telecommunications are regarded as a basic service to combat poverty and develops a strategic 
sectorial proposal for the Science, Technology and Telecommunications proposal establishing 
“…the development of projects stipulating the regulation through legal instruments and rules to 
potentiate performance, promoting the interaction of different actors, creating a physical space, 
to produce and multiply people’s scientific technological capacities”10. This Plan underscores 
the importance of Cybersecurity with a Program to enhance the Electronic Government. 
 
 
 
 
3.2.3   National Development Telecommunications Plan 2015-2021 “Costa Rica: a 
connected society” 
 
This plan intends to put into practice the projects of universal access and service and solidarity, 
besides facilitating the increase of quality telecommunications services at commercial and 
residential level offered to the public, including the expansion of affordable and innovative 
services offered. The plan is articulated as three large pillars, namely: Digital Inclusion, 
Electronic and Transparent Government and Digital Economy. Its highest aspiration is: 
“Transform Costa Rica into a connected society, based on an inclusive approach to the access, 
use and appropriation of the information and communications technologies, safely, responsibly, 
and productively”11. 
 
The abovementioned subjects are drawn along three great 
aspirations: 
 
1.  Consolidate projects of universal access, universal service and solidarity of 
Telecommunications/ICT. 
2.  Create an enabling environment allowing the innovation o f  sound and television 
broadcasting towards its digitization. 
3.  Build the bases of the Digital Cities Model, jointly, with an imminent 
Electronic Government.

Likewise the NDP mentions Cybersecurity as a fundamental subject within the pillars of an 
Electronic and Transparent Government. It seeks for the country to have the Cybersecurity 
protocols implemented in the different Ministries comprising the Executive Power by 2021; 
therefore developing this strategy at national level is essential as baseline of what 
said instruments pursue. 
 
3.3 
Telecommunications sector and its advances 
 
 
 
3.3.1Regulatory framework and its relationship with cybernetic security 
 
By the General Law of Telecommunications, Act N° 8642 and the Law for the Strengthening 
and Modernization of Public Entities of the Telecommunications Sector, Act N° 8660 the 
Telecommunications Sector was created, designating the Ministry of Science, Technology and 
Telecommunications, as the sector’s lead agency, in charge among other aspects of issuing the 
public policy; the Telecommunications Superintendency is constituted (SUTEL), as 
autonomous body attached to the Public Services Regulating Authority (ARESEP), in charge 
of the regulation. 
 
The legal framework is also complemented with a series of regulations which implement the 
mandate of the laws mentioned. In particular, what refers to Cybernetic Security topics, the 
Regulation of Protection Measures for Privacy of Communications12 can be noted which 
elaborates on what article 42 of the General Law of Telecommunications provides; Act N° 8642 
and the Regulation for Protection to the Final User of Telecommunications Services. 
 
In 2012 SUTEL promoted compliance to what’s established in Costa Rican legislation as to 
what’s provided by article 56 paragraph f) of the Regulation of Protection for Final User of 
Telecommunications Services, which refers to the subject of frauds against users, specifically in 
the field of cellular phones robbery and reactivation. During that year meetings were carried out 
with operators and suppliers of telecommunications services, to fulfill with compliance and 
determine the best practices for the inclusion of IMEIS to the blacklists; integration to Groupe 
Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) was the chosen solution, due to the number of  
 
 
12 Reference can also be made to  Executive Decree DE 35.205 16-04-2009 Reglamento Protección Privacidad de 
Comunicaciones y el Reglamento sobre el Régimen de Protección al Usuario Final de los Servicios de 
Telecomunicaciones, of ARESEP Reglamento 010 published in Gaceta N° 72  April 15th of 2010.

countries integrated to it for the exchange of information. GSMA, grouping over 200 countries 
and approximately 800 mobile phone operators, has the databases of stolen terminals available 
for operators (blacklist). 
 
In March of 2012 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the mobile telephone 
operators in the country and GSMA. In said Memorandum a public commitment was agreed of 
integrating the databases of the terminals stolen to such organization and thus blocking the use 
of such terminals at country level for the totality of countries integrated to GSMA. In so doing, 
Costa Rica was the first country in Latin America to connect all its operators with the database of 
GSMA’s stolen terminals. This event made the difference in the region in the fight against theft of 
terminals13. 
 
With the aim of having a tool for addressing fraud by subscription, in conformity to what’s 
provided in article 43 of the Protection Regime of Final User of Telecommunications Services14, 
there is the obligation of carrying out an adequate record of the prepaid services users. For this, 
SUTEL has carried out proceedings to promote the filtering of information from these records, 
particularly considering the existence of a large number of reports of users, and reports showing 
inconsistencies in the record by the operators of prepaid services. Also, several entities such as 
the Judicial Power (PJ) and the Ministry of Public Security (MSP) have insisted on the need 
of having a more reliable record of users, even more when considering SUTEL’s duty of veiling 
f or the rights of telecommunications users, as established by valid legislation. 
 
In compliance to Law Nº 8934, Childhood and Adolescents Protection Law Facing the Harmful 
Contents on the Internet and Other Electronic Media, SUTEL’s council adopted agreement 024-
019-2012 specifying the information and filters Internet cafés should implement for childhood’s 
protection in agreement with the constant search of protecting the population, not only in the 
physical world but also in the digital that in spite of being virtual has real consequences.

In matters of generating capacities, SUTEL collaborates with the Judicial School giving lectures 
and training for the judges in matters of security, within the framework of the training program in 
telecommunications implemented by said School. 
 
Within the regulatory framework, Costa Rica has updated its national regulations creating legal 
development for the protection of Costa Rican cyber-society, enabling the possibility for people 
to report breaches suffered in the virtual world which had no legal answer before. Among these, 
stands out the Law for Protection of Persons for the Processing of Personal Data and its 
Regulation, thus the creation of the Agency for Inhabitants’ Data Protection (PRODHAB), 
governing body in this matter. 
 
There is also the Law for Informatics Crimes, Act Nº 9048 and the Reform of various articles 
and amendment of section VIII, denominated Informatics Crimes and Related from title VII of the 
Criminal Code instituting a more complete legal framework and in agreement with the new 
crimes committed with technological means. 
 
Searching to improve the Costa Rican regulatory framework and achieve a better operation 
before computer crime, Costa Rica consolidated the accession process to the “Convention o 
Cybercrime” known as the “Budapest Convention” by signing Executive Decree N° 40546-
RREE on July 3 of 2017 which supports the fight against informatics crimes.15 
 
With the purpose of having a unit in charge of collecting evidence for addressing crimes 
associated to technology, the Section of Informatics Crimes was created in 1997, as Unit of 
Informatics Investigation, attached to the Department of Criminal Investigations; it was born out 
of the need of processing information stored in computers and servers from important cases; it 
was constituted in 2002 as Section of Informatics Crimes. 
 
This section carries out research of informatics crimes and others related to technologies 
where it’s utilized to commit a criminal act or as evidence. Forensic computer techniques are 
used to that end, aligned with international standards in the collection, preservation and the

processing and storage devices. 
 
 
3.3.2   Internet Exchange Point 
 
According to studies of the project CEPAL @LIS2: Balances, challenges and projections “… 
80% of internet’s Latin American traffic still passes through networks in the United States; 
utilization of international connections in some countries increases prices up to 40%”16. 
 
In Costa Rica’s case, for 2014 MICITT and the National Academy of Sciences (ANC) worked 
jointly to impulse the creation of the Costa Rican Internet Exchange Point (CRIX) constituted as 
project of public interest by Executive Decree Nº 38388- MICITT, "Declaratory of Public Interest: 
The Internet Traffic Exchange Point of the National Academy of Sciences" in La Gaceta Nº 93 
of Friday, May 16 th of 201417. 
 
Internet Exchange Point of Costa Rica (CRIX), is administered by NIC Costa 
Rica, entity in charge of the administration of the higher-level domain .cr and its categories 
. co.cr, .fi.cr, .or.cr, .sa.cr, .ed.cr, .ac.cr y .go.cr; which has managed to build a network of 
national confidence for local infrastructure of the Internet.18 
 
Added to this, the country has become one of the first in the world implementing the origin 
validation (RPKI) in its Internet Exchange Point (IXP). This validation enables the strengthening of 
local Internet traffic in turn avoiding hijacking of routes, seeking among other things, the capture of

3.3.3   Cybernetic Security Practices of Operators in Costa Rica 
 
As part of the construction of this National Strategy of Cybernetic Security, SUTEL supported by 
carrying out a consultation aimed at operators and suppliers on the practices implemented on 
cybersecurity matters. A brief analysis of results is presented following. 
 
The questionnaire was submitted to 17 companies of the sector in 201520, which included 
questions about frequent practices of information security that would be applied by operators and 
suppliers of telecommunications services; information on the type of personnel assigned to 
security tasks; identification of critical infrastructure; information sharing in case of events 
and documentation of cases. Following, a summary of the answers received is presented.

It’s worth noting that 100% of the companies indicated they had a policy or internal procedures to 
guarantee the security and privacy of the internal information and their users. The above 
shows this is an important subject for the sector’s companies and they have searched for 
mechanisms to ensure the integrity of that information. 
 
Despite only one third of the consulted companies state having detected possible threats or 
experiencing an attack over the last year, 100% affirm having their essential infrastructure 
identified; 83% count with procedures to control a nd  monitor changes made on it. Similarly, 
the totality of operators and suppliers of telecommunications services surveyed mention having 
engineers dedicated to cybernetic security-related labors, and in 83% of the cases, have 
received some kind of training last year. These results show how companies have taken 
measures on this subject and prepared their personnel. 
 
However, from the answers we could extract companies do not coordinate between themselves 
facing cyberattacks or share information; also, cases are not all documented. In addition, the 
efforts to disseminate information between the users, made by operators and suppliers diverge 
and don’t reflect a coordinated objective; this is also a topic which should be contemplated by the 
strategy. 
 
3.3.4   National Digital Certification System 
 
Through the enactment of Act Nº 8454, of Certificates, Digital Signatures and Electronic 
Documents, the legal grounds were implemented to issue and use digital signature certificates in 
the country, providing the legal security necessary so that electronic documents signed digitally 
had the same value as documents with handwritten signature. 
 
In August of 2009, the Digital Certification System was launched; it was designed to offer safer 
online transactions. According to the Law, the agency issuing digital certificates should be 
registered with the Digital Signature Certifiers Management (DCFD) of MICITT and ensure 
compliance to the standards of security and operation endorsing electronic transactions. 
 
The existing legal framework in the country allows guaranteeing the transactions’ legal security; 
the protection of consumers’ rights and credibility of the national digital certification system while 
endorsing the transactions electronically, giving legal equivalence to physical documents and 
those issued by electronic means. The system’s regulation and the guidelines are enacted by 
the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT).21

The Central Bank of Costa Rica has constituted a Certifying Authority for issuance of digital 
signature certificates for physical persons (CA SINPE – Physical Person) and legal persons (CA 
SINPE- Legal Person), besides enabling the service of time stamps (TSA SINPE)22. Use of these 
certificates has strengthened the public sector, as well as the services offered, guaranteeing 
safer online transactions. 
 
3.3.5   Costa Rica Computer Security Incident Response Team: CSIRT-CR 
 
This Team was formed by Executive Decree Nº 37052-MICIT of March 09 of 201223. This 
provision designates CSIRT-CR as the agency in charge of coordinating everything related to 
matters of informatics and cybernetics security. It is further empowered to have a team of 
experts i n Information and Communication Technologies security in charge of preventing and 
responding to incidents of informatics and cybernetic security affecting governmental institutions. 
 
CSIRT-CR seeks the implementation and management of technological measures with the 
purpose of mitigating the risk of attacks against the community’s systems providing the service, so 
as to incorporate the cybernetic security system and information technologies to the Central 
Government and Autonomous Entities’ protection and decrease cybernetic risks and threats. 
 
The team is in charge of MICITT’s Directorate of Digital Governance; however, its operation is 
presently limited owing to lack of resources  in  th e  p u b lic sector. Tasks carried out 
to this date have mainly consisted of generation of capacities of the public sector’s officials, 
through different cybersecurity trainings. In addition, CSIRT-CR, has assumed the task of raising 
awareness and informing, with support from specialists in different fields on relevant topics as 
Deep Web and security in bank transactions.

There is the need of having a specific approach in aspects of CSIRT- CR’s development to 
guarantee a better functionality and sustainability. These measures will make it operate 
efficiently and be equipped to rapidly determine threats and apply measures against them, to 
prevent future threats and recover from existent ones. CSIRT shall require the assignment of an 
explicit budget and an operational plan to be able to materialize the functions assigned. 
 
 
3.3.6   National Commission for Online Security 
 
The National Commission for Online Security (CNSL)24 was created in 2010, by Decree Nº 36274-
MICIT with the main objective of designing the necessary policies for the good use of Internet 
and the Digital Technologies, contributing to create a culture of understanding, analysis and 
responsibility in people so they benefit from the advantages of using ICT and have aware and 
proactive attitude before the inherent risks of using these resources. 
 
The commission is headed by MICITT and integrated by representatives of the Ministry of Public 
Education, Ministry of Culture and Youth, National Child Welfare Agency, Judicial Power, 
SUTEL, CAMTIC, Fundación Omar Dengo and Fundación Paniamor. 
 
According to what the Executive Decree Nº 36274-MICIT points out many actions of the 
Commission should be aimed at vulnerable populations in the use of online technologies; one of 
these populations is childhood and adolescents in all the country. In this sense the commission 
formulated a work plan, based on four central themes from which derive a series of work lines; 
they include the strengthening of the regulatory framework, consolidation of inter-institutional 
articulation mechanisms, development of projects promoting online security and fostering 
research as basis for the formulation of actions. 
 
 
3.3.7   Automation and Digitization of Online Services Available to Citizens 
 
As regards development of projects in technology, the country has created a series of initiatives 
in different areas such as access to public information, automation of proceedings and

citizen security where the following are to be mentioned:25 Citizens’ Portal, Open Data, Registry 
of Products of Health Interest, Electronic Services Window (VES), Crea Empresa, MuNet e-
Government and most recently the Public Purchasing System (SICOP). 
 
In health matters, the Single Digital Health Record (EDUS) is noteworthy, a program fostered by 
the Costa Rican Department of Social Security and defined as: “the set of informatics applications 
which automate health system at the three (3) levels of attention in agreement with the health 
services model the institution operates with”26. 
 
As relates to con citizen security, the Ministry of Public Security (MSP) has a platform for safety 
officers and company’s registration procedures, as well Carrying Weapons Control and Private 
Private Security (ControlPas)27. 
 
As to the ICT’s public management, it’s necessary to underscore the inter-institutional 
coordination processes; such is the case with the drivers’ licenses management and passports at 
the Bank of Costa Rica (BCR) agencies. This is owing to the systems’ interoperability of the 
General Migrations and Foreign Citizens Bureau and the Ministry of Public Works and Transport 
(MOPT) with BCR’s platform28 
 
Another important body providing online administrative and electoral services is the Supreme 
Electoral Court (TSE); among the services offered is the management of documents of citizens 
and residents, civil records, marriage contracts and the electoral roll. 
 
Additionally, Costa Ricans have online access to public legal information in virtue of a number of 
government entities having adopted the ICT to provide their services electronically. As part of the 
Modernization of Justice Administration project, the Judicial Power, the Attorney General’s Office 
(PGR) and the Inter-American Development Bank (BID) came together and developed the Costa 
Rican Legal Information System (SCIJ) 29. The system contains regulatory and jurisprudential 
information on Costa Rican law.

Costa Rica’s legal system is also implementing a comprehensive electronic justice portal offering 
diverse online legal services.30 These include institutional audits and records available 
publically, missing persons, the most-wanted list, convicted fugitives’ reports and literature on 
national statutes and laws. The portal also allows citizens to present police reports, pay for legal 
services and request legal consultation within the country’s Court Circuit. At least nineteen 
courts have the capacity to receive online requests for consults. With these services, the judicial 
system has the objective of creating a more transparent and simple process for citizens 
searching legal assistance. 
 
As regards the taking of evidence, the Judicial Power has jurisdictional authority, in conformity to 
article 24 of Act N° 7425, “Act Concerning Search, Seizure and Examination of Private 
Documents and Interception of Communications" 31   to intervene in any communication, oral, 
written or other type, including fixed, mobile, wireless and digital telecommunications. This 
aspect is quite important since electronic evidence implies both security and privacy elements. 
 
With the increase in the number of cases of digital evidence, the interoperability within the 
judicial system should be taken into account to decide on these, and thus guarantee their safety 
and integrity. 
 
In addition and in the interest of making judicial information known, the Judicial Power carries 
out this process taking as reference what’s established by Act Nº 8968 “Act on Protection of 
Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data” and the document Minimum Rules 
for Disclosure of Judicial Information on the Internet where they implement the best practices to 
find balance between privacy and transparency at the moment of making judicial data available 
to the public32.

3.4 
Training in Cybernetic Security 
 
The country is acknowleged for the important investment made on the education sector; by 
constitutional mandate the country dedicates 8% of the Gross Domestic Product to (GDP) 
education. Being a highly relevant area for the country, incorporation of ICT into education, 
has also been considered a national priority, and there are diverse projects since the late 80’s. 
 
At present, MEP, MICITT and SUTEL, in unison to other public organizations, non- 
governmental, private, academic and civil society have implemented projects to narrow the 
gaps in education through the use of ICT, employing resources of the National 
Telecommunications Fund (FONATEL). The objective of these initiatives has been to 
transform teaching and learning processes through the universal access to broadband 
connectivity, mobile technologies and the education support instruments of ICT for teachers 
and students. 
At present 63% of educational institutions at secondary level have a computer laboratory, 
compared to 23% for primary schools 33 and efforts are on the way to improve these figures. 
 
As refers to the training of professionals, public and private universities offer careers with 
graduate, post-graduate and specializations34 in themes related to ICT; however, not 
necessarily including specializations in Cybernetic Security, except for a private education 
center which offer training at master’s level. 
 
The program of this post-graduate in Cybersecurity, is oriented to the training of professionals 
of information and communication security; in the development of technical and management 
abilities, as well as an introduction to the required theoretical aspects in this field. To complete

private education sector access possibilities are limited by the economic investment required. 
 
When considering the association with higher education institutions, different approaches must 
be taken into account based on the nature of constituting each one. For example, public 
universities are autonomous, although having common standards and coordinating among them 
(National Council of Rectors (CONARE) / Higher Education Planning Office (OPES)); the National 
Council for Higher University Education (CONESUP) authorizes and supervises private 
universities and the National System for Higher Education Accreditation (SINAES) certifies 
authorized public and private academic programs. 
 
In view of the foregoing, there is a need for joint work with various educational institutions and 
accreditation organisms to open courses including relevant aspects of information/cybernetics 
security. In addition, it’s important to take in consideration the scientific school’s network and 
those having computer laboratories, to foster the teaching of the fundamental aspects of 
cybernetic security from secondary education. 
 
 
3.4.1    Strengthening of the legal framework for addressing cybercrime 
 
It is often complex to prevent a cybernetic crime and sometimes even more difficult identifying the 
author. Cybernetic crimes can be described in two ways: crimes against an informatics system (for 
example, harm or unauthorized access to data, programs or networks) and crimes facilitated 
through an informatics system (for example, publication of child pornography). Along these lines, 
there are various laws in Costa Rica35 engaged in cybernetic crime, directly and indirectly. The 
next figure summarizes the topics included.

Legislation on cybernetic crime should consider the national context, international conventions, 
mechanisms for enabling inter-institutional and multi-jurisdictional investigation and the greater 
complexity of technological advances. Costa Rica has legislation related to informatics crimes; 
notwithstanding, as the sophistication of these crimes changes, there should be a process 
dedicated to its review and updating to ensure there is the authority necessary to investigate and 
process it effectively. Adherence to the Convention on Cybernetic Crime (also known as 
Budapest Convention) is a fact and discussions are on the way within of the Judicial Power for 
the training of judges and prosecutors in cybernetic crime matters. 
 
However, in achieving those goals, a distinction should be made between the technical capacity 
to detect and identify vulnerabilities and the procedural tools necessary so that law 
enforcement agencies effectively investigate cybernetic crimes (taking into account the speed 
and transient nature of digital data). The roles and responsibilities of the Internet services 
suppliers should be considered, as well as any other actor active in cyberspace; also balancing 
these actions with the need to respect the fundamental human rights while collecting digital 
evidence. So, given the nature of the digital world it’s necessary to count with the corresponding 
mechanisms to ensure the periodical review and update of informatics crimes legislation.

Chapter 4 – Guiding Principles 
 
This strategy is motivated on the following guiding principles: 
 
 
People are the Priority 
 
Respect for Human Rights and Privacy. 
 
Coordination and co-responsibility of Multiple Stakeholders. 
 
International Cooperation  
 
 
4.1 People are the Priority 
 
People are the strategy’s focus. The use of ICT in the different fields of daily life obliges us to 
include all country citizens in the strategy, so co-responsibility in the individual use of devices and 
networks shall be essential. 
 
With the foregoing, use of ICT as an instrument for life quality improvement shall be safely 
promoted, seeking to raise awareness on the consequences of the responsible use through 
education from the earliest ages. Any action should have the priority of involving the attention 
and mitigation of risks having an impact mainly o n  vulnerable populations a s  childhood, 
adolescents, the elder adults, indigenous populations and people with some type of disability. 
 
4.2 Respect for Human Rights and Privacy 
 
 Access to information and respect for privacy, are fundamental to guarantee respect for human 
rights, specifically those related with access to ICT. The resulting measures and actions from 
this strategy should always safeguard human rights and the privacy of the information for all 
citizens of the country. 
 
Consequently, this strategy has been developed taking into account the need to balance the 
protection of every citizen and respect for the basic and essential human rights, with the need 
to implement measures to keep them safes online. This includes respecting liberty of expression, 
freedom of speech, right to privacy, freedom of opinion and freedom of association.

4.3 Coordination and Co-responsibility of Multiple Stakeholders 
 
Cybersecurity is a responsibility shared by all actors participating in the digital ecosystem, which 
including users. Whenever relevant, it’s imperative all actions derived from this strategy take into 
account, the participation and contribution of all stakeholders, co-responsibility of these and the 
need of coordination among different actors. 
 
For the process of implementation, support of all sectors is essential; so, the public-public, 
public-private and public-civil society models should be considered and promoted; as 
appropriate, the requirements and outreach of the objectives to implement. 
 
4.4 International Cooperation  
 
The cross-border nature of digital technologies requires the subject of cybersecurity be 
addressed from a global perspective. Cybernetic threats have no borders; therefore, 
international cooperation becomes key element both for addressing threats and for the transfer 
of knowledge and development of local and global actions assisting to increase confidence and 
global security. 
 
Hence, the construction of alliances, agreements and the strengthening of ties with other public 
and private entities attending Cybersecurity related topics at regional and international level 
should be key elements, among others.

Specific Objective 2: Public Awareness 
 
 
Develop and/or implement awareness and education campaigns on cybernetic 
security that foster responsibility for digital protection as a duty of all users of 
digital technologies. 
Measures should be taken for awareness regarding cybernetic security, among citizens, public 
officers and companies, to ensure they are well informed and educated about the existing risks. 
Cybernetic security is one of the most important economic and national challenges; it has an 
impact on all social actors. Educating our citizens is a fundamental step towards strong 
cybernetic resilience as a Nation, acknowledging many Costa Ricans use the security tools 
available on the open market (for example, antivirus and firewalls) and are responsible for their 
personal informatics systems security measures. Citizens also use computers and other mobile 
terminals at their work places and have access to sensible data which should be protected. 
 
Strategic Line 2.1.         Consciousness - General Public 
 
 
Develop awareness campaigns in cybersecurity for Costa Rica’s residents so they get 
used to and accept good practices as part of their culture, regarding the strengthening of 
actions for the protection of vulnerable population groups as childhood and 
adolescents, elder adults, indigenous population, disabled population. Everything in 
alliance with the private sector, civil society and non-governmental organizations 
dedicated to the protection of childhood and adolescents. 
 
Strategic Line 2.2.         Public Sector  
 
 
Develop awareness and education campaigns aimed at public officers and focused on the 
type of institution where they work, emphasizing on better protection practices and 
safeguarding access details to information systems and sensitive or personal data 
contained in those systems. 
 
Strategic Line 2.3.       Micro, Small and Medium-sized Business 
 


Specific Objective 3. Development of National Capacity in Cybernetic Security 
 
 
Carry out training campaigns exclusively for the public sector having the 
education of final users in cybernetic security concepts and good practices as 
objective and preparing expert users (developers, administrators, directives) in 
cybernetic security techniques. 
Many organizations have not been able to address cybernetic security comprehensively, either 
because the information security function has not been assigned to a specific person or unit, 
have not adequately addressed the need of including it in their commercial operations or 
simply don’t have the resources necessary to assign it. 
 
A comprehensive part of the strategy shall be the implementation of measures destined to 
literacy, awareness and training of human resources in themes of cybernetic security. The level 
of competence is highly important for all personnel with public institutions, especially 
administrators and those responsible of decision-making, since attacks are often done under the 
social engineering modality aimed at strategic employees or functionaries to have access to their 
protected information systems. 
 
The main purpose of a cybernetic security culture is the protection of informatics systems and 
the adoption of good cybernetic practices by these users. 
 
Strategic Line 3.1.         Training of Specialized Human Resources 
 
 
Foster the dissemination and promotion of specialization or training opportunities in 
cybernetic security available locally or internationally to functionaries of the public sector. 
 
Propose and impulse adjustments in the academic offer that allow developing study 
plans in cybernetic security or add cybersecurity modules to pertinent pre-graduate, 
post-graduate and doctorate programs. 
 
Promote the inclusion of the cybersecurity topic in at least one course of non- 
technological careers. 
Strategic Line 3.2.          Research and Development 
 
 
Form alliances with public and private universities to develop research projects on the 
emerging threats and the development of innovative solutions to cybernetic incidents.

Specific Objective 4. Strengthening of Legal Framework in Cybersecurity and ICT 
 
 
Conduct a review of the existing legal framework and propose the necessary 
adjustments to carry out legal proceedings and institutional arrangements which 
guarantee an adequate investigation and effective prosecution. 
Informatics crime evolves as fast as technology which means legal provisions should be 
reviewed and adapted permanently, to take into account new types and methodologies used 
by criminals when committing informatics crimes. 
 
A national dialogue about the international cooperation agreements is necessary as relates to 
cybernetic security, with the purpose of creating greater conscience of the need to facilitate an 
unobstructed process for the application of valid norms, given the quick rhythm of development 
and change of ICT. 
 
Costa Rica’s legal framework shall take into account the cross-border nature of cyberspace; the 
need that those responsible for enforcing the law can effectively investigate cybernetic crimes 
(considering the speed and transitory nature of digital data), the need that incidents’ response 
teams be able to detect an incident timely, and dote the corresponding entities with the necessary 
authority to dissuade identified threats 
 
Strategic Line 4.1.      Strengthening the normative and procedural framework in cybercrime 
 
 
Create a specialized commission for the review of valid existing regulations to guarantee 
there are adequate procedural tools in cybernetic crime matters. 
 
Strategic Line 4.2.          Create capacities in Cybersecurity for the application of the law 
in the criminal justice system

 
Create   networks of trust   supported by a non-disclosure legal instrument for the safe 
exchange of relevant information linked to cybernetic crimes. 
 
Design expedited procedures for the exchange of confidential information. 
 
 
Specific Objective 5: Protection of Critical Infrastructures  
 
 
 
Promote mechanisms for identification and protection of critical 
infrastructures, as well as for creation specific public policies, as essential step to 
prevent and/or mitigate cybernetic security incidents aimed at a damaging o 
discontinuing sensitive operations. 
By critical infrastructures is understood the group of facilities, systems, equipment, networks, 
data and services whose interruption or destruction would have a high negative impact on a 
country’s basic services, seriously affecting the social and economic welfare of all inhabitants. 
The chain of supply of goods and services supporting the operation of critical infrastructures is a 
risk to be assessed taking account of the security measures implemented by these suppliers. 
 
In view of the foregoing, this objective is seeking to define a series of activities to ensure the 
continuity, functionality and integrity of critical infrastructures; with the aim of preventing, 
managing, mitigating and/or restoring its functions before an eventual cybernetic attack. 
 
It is crucial that critical infrastructures operators employ specific security frameworks to manage 
the evolution of security risks in the acquisition of ICT goods and services. For example, the 
outsourcing of network operations may increase the risks if suppliers of those services are not 
willing to agree on a minimum standard of provision, including acceptable response time and 
application of minimum-security measures. 
 
As part of the process to safeguard the critical infrastructure, use of the Industrial Systems 
Control (SCI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) should be 
specifically examined. Industrial systems are now designed with more connection capacity; 
therefore, they imply a greater threat to cybersecurity. It is crucial that regulatory entities of 
classified sectors such as the critical infrastructure assume a more significant role and start 
defining and dictating clear guidelines on cybernetic security and so that regulated entities 
comply with the existing regulations, standards and good practices of their particular sector as 
well as those nationally binding. 
 
The implementation of guidelines and greater cooperation among the critical infrastructures 
operators, ICT services suppliers, systems suppliers and the State is vital.  

MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
- 43 - 
www.micitt.go.cr 
 
 
 
Any infringement of security having a significant impact on the services supplier’s operation 
should be mitigated; SCI and SCADA operators shall thus be encouraged to implement security 
policies which establish the approach of identified risks and possible vulnerabilities. 
 
Some norms shall be considered in the construction of resilience in this sector; for example, the 
ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 norms shall be included; NERC CIP-002-3 through CIP-009- 
3 38 , Special Publication NIST 800-82 and the Framework for Improving the Critical 
infrastructure Cybernetic Security39, among others. 
 
Strategic Line 5.1 Identification and Classification of Critical Infrastructures 
 
 
Identify the country’s critical infrastructures as essential step for the application of 
security measures. 
 
Create a commission to create public policy comprised by a representative and a 
substitute from each one of the public institutions and private entities identified, with the 
purpose of ensuring the operating conditions and ongoing stability of these services. 
Strategic Line 5.2.          Implementation of security measures on the Public 
Administration’s Information and Telecommunications Systems  
 
 
Design cybersecurity protocols for the executive Power’s Ministries, consistent with the 
maturity of each of the institutions and the public sector’s current needs.

Specific Objective 6: Risk Management 
 
 
Promote the implementation of a risk management model adapted to the own 
needs of each institution or organization. 
At managerial level of any organization, the adoption of a risk management process is basic for the 
review of important risks related to information technologies, which could occur regularly, and 
which would provide a consistent approach in the appropriation of this operation. Many entities 
have problems and deficiencies in that area; consequently there is no evaluation, measurement, 
nor adequate communication of the extent in which their operations are being affected by 
cybernetic attacks; nor the operations forwarded to build their cybernetic resilience. This 
understanding is essential to be able to effectively approach cybernetic risk. 
 
An effective cybernetic security regime adopts or develops a framework with a continuous cycle 
of risk evaluation activity, risk control, development of general security policies, business 
continuity guarantee, allocation of responsibilities, promotion de awareness and follow-up of the 
effectiveness of controls implemented. Business Continuity planning is a proactive measure 
ensuring that in case of emergencies, system failures or disasters, it is possible to recover and 
keep up the normal business functions in case some serious risk occurs. Uncertainty is a central 
theme on Information Technologies Risks and consequently the implementation of the best 
management practices is required. 40 
 
Thus, the Software Engineering Institute Risk Management Model (SEI), the Federal Information 
Security Management (FISMA) Risk Management Framework and the ISO/IEC INTE 27000 
norms, shall be taken in consideration, among others.

and close the gaps that could occur as a consequence of changes and the new risks, should be 
applied as soon as possible. 
 
Deficiencies in cybernetic security often result from inadequate allocation of human and financial 
resources. The country has many capacities to effectively approach the cybernetic security 
issues, but the definition of responsibility and assignment of efficient resources is required.

The concept of a risk-based approach ensures the cybernetic security resilience construction 
process is interactive and follow-up may be done. 
 
Thus, to measure the progress and success of this strategy, MICITT shall be entitled to request 
reports from the different actors, about the advance of the tasks assigned. Consequently, as 
National Coordinator it will evaluate the advance of the activities, propose recommendations and 
inform the President of the Republic and the Governing Board annually on the strategy’s 
implementation advances.

Chapter 8 –Final Reflections 
 
Costa Rica shall initiate the establishment of a solid base for the next generations by delimiting 
the areas of interest for the application of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. 
 
Investment in ICT solutions shall not only continue improving the quality of life of inhabitants, but 
also significantly transform the way we see the world and how we interact. 
 
Through the systematic application of lines of action, it is intended Costa Rica continue to be a 
leader in the area of ICT research and development, also a source of qualified human resources in 
the field of cybernetic security and information. 
 
From a national perspective, cybernetic security can only be implemented from an approach with 
multiple phases and perspectives. This shall ensure the key areas necessary are developed 
simultaneously for national cybernetic resilience. 
 
Acknowledging the fact that an informatics threat is not a future development but a current reality, 
Costa Rica shall destine the necessary government resources to ensure success of this strategy 
and make alliances with all stakeholders to advance in its objectives and goals. The Executive 
Power shall promote a cybersecurity culture at the public sector level with the aim the budgetary 
assignment in this area is established.
