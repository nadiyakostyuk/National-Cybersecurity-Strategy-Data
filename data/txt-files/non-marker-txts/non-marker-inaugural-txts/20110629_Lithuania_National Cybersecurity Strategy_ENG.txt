Of 29 June 2011  
 
 
THE PROGRAMME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC 
INFORMATION SECURITY (CYBER-SECURITY) FOR 2011–2019  
 
 
I. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
1. The Programme for the Development of Electronic Information Security (Cyber-
Security) for 2011–2019 has been developed considering the increasing significance of 
electronic information, processed and transmitted by means of information and 
communication technologies, and also considering the fact that the newly emerged 
possibilities of electronic information processing fostered the development of national and 
global information societies and facilitated further modernization of national economies as 
well as led to more efficient public administration, while at the same time, with more and 
more information being converted into electronic format and various public administration 
and economic processes being automated, the global cyberspace and the public services 
delivered online have become an attractive target for individuals, criminal groups, political 
forces and other subjects. 
2. The purpose of the Programme is to determine the objectives and tasks for the 
development of electronic information in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and 
accessibility of electronic information and services provided in cyberspace, safeguarding of 
electronic communication networks, information systems and critical information 
infrastructure against incidents and cyber attacks, protection of personal data and privacy, as 
well as to set the tasks, implementation of which would allow total security of cyberspace and 
entities operating in this medium.  
3. The strategic objective of the Programme is the development of the security of 
electronic information in Lithuania, ensuring cyber security in order to achieve, in the year 
2019, a 98 per cent level of compliance of state-owned information resources with legislative 
requirements on electronic information security (cyber security), reduction to 0.5 hour of the 
average time of response to critical information infrastructure incidents and a 60 per cent level 
of the Lithuanian residents who feel secure in cyberspace. 
4. The terms used in the Programme shall have the following meaning: 
Information resources shall mean an aggregate of information which is managed by 
members of the information society and processed by means of information technology as 
well as the information technology means used to process the said information. 
Incident shall mean an event, act or omission which gives rise or may give rise to an 
unauthorized access to an information system or electronic communications network, 
disruption or change of the operation (including takeover of control) of an information system 

 
2
or electronic communications network, destruction, damage, deletion or the change of 
electronic information, removal or limiting of the possibility to use electronic information 
and, also, which gives rise or may give rise to the appropriation, publication, dissemination or 
any other use of non-public electronic information by persons unauthorized to do so.  
Critical information infrastructure shall mean an electronic communications 
network, information system or a group of information systems where an incident that occurs 
causes or may cause grave damage to national security, national economy or social well-
being. 
5. The Programme complies with the action steps presented in the Communication of 
the European Commission of 30 March 2009 “Protecting Europe from large scale cyber-
attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness, security and resilience” – COM(2009)149.  
 
II. OBJECTIVES, TASKS, ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND THEIR INDICATORS  
 
6. For the purpose of Programme implementation the following objectives shall be 
established: 
6.1. To ensure the security of state-owned information resources.  
This objective is being addressed, since no system for coordination of the management 
of electronic information security has yet been created, except in the public sector (i.e. in the 
institutions accountable to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania). The Ministry of the 
Interior has no power to exercise a proper control and coordination for ensuring the security 
of electronic information (cyber security), the governance and supervision structure at the 
level of state and public institutions is not hierarchical, the lack of cooperation among 
Lithuanian public and private sector entities prevents an efficient planning of the development 
of the sphere of electronic information security (cyber security), the existing and regularly 
detected vulnerabilities of information technologies, if not removed on time, give rise to the 
disruption of the operation of information resources as well as critical information 
infrastructures, while the efficiency of detection and removal of these vulnerabilities increases 
through the centralization of said activities. The compliance with the requirements on 
electronic information security (cyber security) ensures that information resources are 
managed in accordance with the requirements of international standards and examples of 
good practice, however, Lithuania has no efficient compliance management structure; the 
information maturity model of an organization allows for a better awareness among 
information resources managers of the need for information resources security and a more 
efficient management thereof. The dependence of different state and public activity areas on 
the use of information resources and services varies, therefore, in order to use funds 
efficiently, it is necessary to consolidate efforts and information resources in the areas where 
this dependence is stronger; the rate of criminal acts in cyberspace is rapidly increasing and 
large scale incidents in cyberspace can lead to a national crisis. 

 
3
There is no law on electronic information security (cyber security) and the regulation 
thereof by legal acts of lower force is fragmentary and does not cover all members of the 
information society, at the same time, there is no legal basis to allow an efficient response to 
incidents in public electronic communications networks, the providers of electronic 
communications and Internet access services are not required to report the incidents to the 
National Electronic Communications Network and Information Security Incidents 
Investigation Service CERT-LT (hereinafter referred to as CERT-LT). Consequently, the 
instructions of the national CERT-LT for services’ providers regarding the elimination of 
incidents are not mandatory either, there is no legal basis to regulate the use of identification 
measures directed at reducing the risk of identity falsification and theft in cyberspace. 
Often, the services delivered by providers of Internet and other information 
infrastructure services do not ensure their users’ security. During the period of economic 
hardship, electronic information security (cyber security) received neither sufficient attention 
nor information resources, however, the application of the principle of collective security 
would allow for a more efficient use of information resources; no backup information 
resources or backup infrastructure to sustain the emergency operation of critical 
infrastructures and information resources have yet been developed. Reliable identification 
reduces the risk of major threats related to cyberspace and increases users’ confidence in 
cyberspace. 
Secure cyberspace (i.e. assurance of electronic information security (cyberspace) 
security) is the concern of all entities whose activities are related to the provision of services 
in cyberspace (public institutions, private economic entities, academic society and others). 
Electronic information security (cyberspace security) projects implemented in cooperation 
enable the achievement of protection of all stakeholders’ interests.  
Cyberspace is a global space which has no national boundaries, hence, the rapid 
spread of threats across cyberspace. The European Union and NATO devote much attention 
to the security of electronic information and critical information infrastructure. It would be 
appropriate to apply the principle of collective security not only on a national, but also on 
international level. Cooperation among highly competent experts, exchange of available 
information and experience is a prerequisite for an efficient early warning and preventive 
action. 
6.2. To ensure an efficient functioning of critical information infrastructure.  
The objective is being pursued, since, currently, the security of critical information 
infrastructure is ensured only on an institutional level, the coordination structure is not yet in 
place, no analysis of relationship between objects of this infrastructure or the national impact 
of its failure has been done, there is no planning of the continuity of activities. Penetration test 
is the most objective method to evaluate the proper functioning of a security system, however, 
neither a regulatory framework for its application nor a practice of such testing exist. An 
efficient monitoring system facilitates the prevention of incidents.  

 
4
6.3. To seek to ensure the cyber security of the Lithuanian residents and persons 
staying in Lithuania. 
This objective is being pursued, since not all users of electronic information are 
concerned about electronic information security (cyber security), there is a shortage – and it is 
likely to be felt even more in the future – of qualified electronic information security experts. 
Basic knowledge and tools of electronic information security (cyber security) allow the users 
to avoid many threats facing them in cyberspace. 
To ensure cyberspace security it is necessary to establish a continuous and properly 
managed system covering all phases of incident management, such as early warning, 
prevention, detection, elimination and investigation. An effective way to fight against 
malware spreading via remote control computer networks or other malicious cyber activities 
is to block Internet access to persons and/or equipment engaged in malicious activates. The 
current social stereotype is that illegal activities conducted in cyberspace are not punishable, 
therefore, it is important that this stereotype be removed. 
Cyber attacks launched from an overseas source can and must be stopped across 
Lithuania’s virtual cyber perimeter in order to avoid their impact on the national electronic 
communications network. The Lithuanian Internet Traffic Exchange (ITE) node, being a 
naturally emerged entity, serves as a convenient and efficient centre for hosting protection 
capabilities of Lithuania's cyberspace (as well as of its virtual perimeter). 
Given the implementation of a one-stop-shop principle, the prevailing trend in the area 
of electronic services is that of unification and centralization; it would be appropriate to 
exploit this trend also for ensuring the security of these services. The users’ confidence in 
cyberspace services is a major factor of the popularity and further development of these 
services.  
7. In order to achieve the objective specified in paragraph 6.1 of the Programme, the 
following tasks shall be implemented: 
7.1. to improve the coordination and supervision of electronic information security 
(cyber security); 
7.2. to improve the regulatory framework of electronic information security (cyber 
security); 
7.3. to expand and improve a secure national information infrastructure; 
7.4. to promote the implementation of electronic information (security cyber security) 
projects;  
7.5. to develop international cooperation in the area of electronic information security 
(cyber security).  
8. In order to achieve the objective specified in paragraph 6.2 of the Programme, it is 
necessary to implement the task of ensuring the security of critical information infrastructure.  
9. In order to achieve the objective specified in paragraph 6.3 of the Programme, the 
following tasks must be implemented:  

 
5
9.1. to enhance the culture of protection of electronic information security (cyber 
security); 
9.2. to strengthen Lithuania’s cyber security;  
9.3. to ensure the protection of Lithuania’s virtual cyber perimeter from external cyber 
attacks; 
9.4. to reinforce the security of services delivered in cyberspace.  
10. The assessment criteria for Programme implementation and their indicators to be 
attained in 2011, 2015 and 2019 are specified in the Annex to the Programme. 
11. Taking into account the fact that the Programme covers one area, the 
administration of which falls under the responsibility of the Minister of the Interior, no 
allocation of EU-financed Programme funding among Programme implementing institutions 
will be planned.  
 
III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME  
  
12. Coordination of Programme implementation shall be carried out by the Ministry of 
the Interior (hereinafter referred to as Programme Coordinator). 
13. Responsibility for the implementation of the objectives and tasks of the 
Programme shall be with the institutions and bodies specified in the Annex to the Programme. 
14. Institutions participating in the implementation of the Programme shall: 
14.1. taking into account the tasks and targeted outcomes laid down in the Programme, 
plan the level of the outcome to be achieved within the planned period, select measures and 
plan funds and include them into strategic action plans and/or annual action plans and 
annually, by 1 August, submit this information to the Programme Coordinator; 
14.2. submit annually, by 1 February, to the Programme Coordinator information on 
implemented measures and achieved results. 
15. The Programme Coordinator shall: 
15.1. supervise the implementation of the strategic goal, objectives and tasks of the 
Programme, carry out an interim review of the tasks laid down in the Programme and changes 
in the levels of task assessment criteria and, if necessary, initiate an update of the Programme; 
15.2. present information on implementation and results of the Programme in an 
annual Programme Coordinator’s Activity Report. 
16. Preparation of additional legal acts other than referred to in paragraph 14.1 of the 
Programme will not be required.
