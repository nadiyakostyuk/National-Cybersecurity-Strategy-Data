EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
An increased dependence on ICTs has brought enormous benefits to society; 
and the internet has become a driving force for productivity and development 
for national economies. Currently, innovative transformations are happening 
in many organizations especially in the area of moving business operations 
and services online. By extension, the pervasive use of mobile applications, 
fintech solutions and automation have also impacted positively on businesses 
around the world. 
This goes to suggests that as long as our critical infrastructure continues to 
connect to computers and information networks, we will inevitably continue 
to rely on them to deliver services. In recent years, Cybersecurity is increasing 
its significance due to the overwhelming use of devices which require the use 
of internet. This development has implications for criminal exploitation of 
information systems. 
In an attempt to address the cybercrime challenge and continue to remain 
proactive in national response, the Gambia government has embarked on 
measures designed to facilitate ICT integration into all sectors of Gambian 
economy. For this to be realized, safety and security should be central in 
national development initiatives. 
The formulation of the draft Gambia Cyber Security Strategy and Action plan 
2016 is a positive step and a long-term measure for protecting the country 
from cyber related security risks. The initiative ushered in a call for the 
development of a national cyber security policy and strategic Action plan.  
This will ultimately pave the way for full implementation of the objectives and 
goals set in the policy. 

Page 6  of 
GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024 
 
The purpose of this Strategic Plan is to build Gambia’s capability to prevent, 
protect, detect, respond and manage cyber threats against information 
systems, critical infrastructures and services. By extension, establish and 
strengthen the organizational policy and institutional foundations for cyber 
infrastructure protection across all sectors. It would be also useful in 
identifying loopholes, inadequacies and other necessities that must be 
address by government and the private sector in order to adequately meet the 
challenges ahead.

1. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Being an entity of numerous opportunities, the cyberspace is a promising 
avenue for transforming and strengthening national economies into a 
knowledge-based society. However, criminal misuse of cyber space is a 
serious challenge and threat to our information systems, services and critical 
infrastructures. It is precisely because of this phenomenon, critical 
infrastructure protection should be an important component of Gambia’s 
national security program. 
This National Cyber Security Plan will serve as a guide to protect the nation’s 
information systems, critical infrastructures and Gambia’s Cyberspace in 
general. It is a working plan envisaged to eventually generate a platform for 
coordination, cooperation and collaboration between the public and private 
sectors. It also envisions the harmonization of national cyber security policies 
and programs. The National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan shall be 
the cornerstone of the country’s cyber security policy.

2. 
NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 
 
This national Cyber security strategy provides guidance on the development 
of a national cyber-security ecosystem. This includes legal, regulatory and 
institutional framework, building cyber-security capacity and capabilities and 
development of standards and guidelines to: 
(i) Ensure that critical ICT systems and infrastructure in public and 
private sectors are protected and made resilient. 
(ii) Foster adoption of security standards and guidelines within Government 
and the private sector. 
The draft National Cyber Security strategy 2016 came as a result of several 
consultations and workshops conducted by MOICI-PURA in collaboration 
with international partners (Bird & Bird – Civipol, Expertise France and CMM 
Oxford) among others. The successful outcome of these engagements 
ushered in the draft National Cybersecurity Strategy Formulation and Action 
Plan 2016. This strategy outlines Gambia’s Vision, Mission for Cyber security 
and ways to improve or calibrate the Cyber security posture. This initiative 
primarily seeks to address the national cybersecurity threats against 
information systems, and critical infrastructures and services. 
While the proposed strategy focuses on the nature and characteristics of 
information and communication technology, the important physical aspects 
and dimensions of critical infrastructure protection including measures to 
respond to challenges of cyber threats were considered. To address cyber 
security awareness challenge, the involvement of civil society to help raise 
awareness, establish and promote cybersecurity education and Training and 
to build national capacity and capabilities all forms an integral part of the 
Gambia’s strategic cybersecurity goals etc. This provides a holistic approach 
and direction to cyber security measures from strategic, tactical to 
operational aspects of Cyber security. 

Page 9  of 
GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024 
 
As a global challenge, Cyber security demands both domestic and 
international solutions. Given the shared nature of vulnerabilities, the 
national cyber security strategy would need strong partnership between 
public and private sectors. In this endeavor, the Strategy and Action Plan 
creates a coherent vision to ensuring that The Gambia cyberspace is secure 
through collective efforts of all stakeholders (i.e. government, private sector, 
civil society, citizens and international) cooperation and collaboration. To this 
end, GoTG is committed to collaborate with regional and international partner 
in creating solutions to address the Cyber security challenges. 
2.1 Vision 
 
To provide trusted, secure and resilient cyberspace for the Government, 
corporate businesses and citizenry to further enhance socioeconomic 
development of the people through ICT transformations. 
2.2 Mission 
 
To develop and deliver effective Cyber security capacity, services and 
infrastructure that instills confidence in Gambian cyberspace. 
2.3 Strategic Goals
