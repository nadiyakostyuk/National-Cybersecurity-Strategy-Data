CYBER SECURITY AND
DEFENSE POLICY OF
INDONESIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2013, Indonesia topped China and was acknowledged as the country with the highest
rate of cyber attack traffic, in which with its 1,6 percent share of world Internet users,
Indonesia contribute 38 percent of the total cyber attack in the world. Furthermore, as
one of large emerging economic countries, Indonesia will definitely more rely on the
use of Internet in the future. However, the current cyber security and defense policy of
Indonesia has not adequately addressed the current cyber threats, so that leave
vulnerability to its cyber environment. This policy brief identifies five inadequate cyber
aspects of the contemporary policy and therefore recommends that the policy should
have a larger strategy that covers all cyber possibilities, yet provide more detail and
measurable approach. This recommendation contributes to the Indonesian national
security and defense goals, as well as building regional collaboration, thereby
supporting global cyber security resilience.

Key Messages:

- Cyber issue must be securitized as the top security policy priority of Indonesia
Government should provide a holistic legal framework by applying preemptive
approach
Besides addressing technical discourse, the policy should cover crime-espionage

and civil-military measure standards

The importance of central cyber commander to lead and coordinate the
organization and implementation of policy

The significance of involving civilian role to contribute to national cyber security
and defense governance

Optimizing an active role of Indonesia in the global cyber cooperation




The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released the Global Cybersecurity
Index (GCI) in 2014 and placed Indonesia in the 13th rank among 105 countries [1].
This ranking shows the cyber security readiness of the country, but not its
vulnerabilities [2]. Within one decade, from 2006 to 2016, according to the Association
of Internet Service Providers of Indonesia (APJII), there had been more than 400
percents of increasing number of Internet users in Indonesia from 20 millions to 88
millions users, with the percentage of penetration from 8.9 to 34.1 [3]. One of the
primary drivers of this great growing is the significant rising number of smartphone
that contribute three-quarter to the total Internet users in Indonesia, which rank 3 in
the Asia Pacific [4].

However, the cyber security mindset and awareness of Indonesian citizen and
institution have been growing very slow that result in an imbalance towards the
positive growth of Internet users [5]. As a consequence, there has been much
vulnerability in Indonesia cyber environment that offer a tremendous opportunity for
cyber attack. Furthermore, on the top of the findings, as Akamai International reported
in 2013 that Indonesia with its 1.6 percent share of world Internet users has the highest
rate of cyber traffic attack in the world, which contribute 38 percent to the total of world
cyber attack [6].



The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Indonesia identifies six attack methods of
cyber as the threat [7], which are:

1. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) that includes Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS)
Defacement Attacks
Malware Attacks
Cyber Infiltrations that includes fraud and espionage

Spamming and Phishing

AMAR Y Ph

Abuse of Communication Protocol

In 2013, the Daka Advisory
estimated the total loss of
Indonesia due to the direct
and indirect impact of
cyber crime, was USD 4,2
billion, which represented
the amount of 2.1 percent
of the total Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of

Indonesia [5]. In addition
to this economic impact, the other main aspect that might result in danger due to cyber

attack is the national security of Indonesia that can be seen from the espionage case of

the President of Indonesia by Australia in 2014 [8].



Policy Discussion:

Under the Government Regulation Number 82, Indonesia government through the
coordination of the Ministry of Communication and Information (MCI) and Ministry
of Defense (MoD) introduce the Cyber Security and Defense Policy [9]. The main
objective of this policy is to ‘maintain and protect the country’s sovereignty, territorial
integrity and safety of the nation from any potential threats’ [10]. To achieve this
objective, the policy uses a Holistic approach that involves not only government
institutions but also all entities of the nation namely citizen, community, business

sector, and education institutions [9]. There are five agendas of the policy.

Part 1, the Government of Indonesia emphasizes the importance of formulating a legal
framework to provide a law-based foundation in addressing related cyber threats. In
the contemporary time, the government uses a reactive approach in determining

cyber-related regulations.

Part 2, the policy regulates technical and procedural measures to standardize the
enhancement of all entities in the field of cyber security. By this policy, the government
of Indonesia sought to make sure all parts of cyber security methods not only have the
legal framework but also comply with the national security standard. There are five
cyber security standards that have been regulated, which are:
a. The Indonesia National Standard (SNI) that regulates the management system
of information security.
b. Health and Safe Internet Program to optimize information security in cyber
dimension.
c. Trust+ to sort out negative content.
d. Perisai to protect and educate Indonesian children in cyberspace.

Nawala Project to protect the connection of Internet from destructive content

Part 3, the Indonesian Government distribute the cyber security and defense
responsibility into three divisions, which are government agencies, educations
institutions and communities, and business entities. This policy attempts to enable all
entities of the country to involve in securing and defending cyberspace vigorously. The
MCI represents the government agency to coordinate the business, community and
education entities, and the cyber defense function is led by the MoD.




Part 4, the Government of Indonesia focuses on ensuring and developing an adequate
cyber capacity of human resources and government agencies. By this policy, the
government tries to ensure all responsible cyber units have an adequate ability to secure
and defend their space from cyber threats and attacks. There are two mechanisms of
this policy, which are:
a. Indonesia National Work Competence Standards in Information Security
(SKKNI-SI) that aim to improve the cyber security capacity of human resources.
b. Information Security Index (KAMI Index) that applies to assess the information

security maturity of all cyber-related agencies.

Part 5, the policy emphasizes the significance of international cooperation as an
essential effort to support the domestic anticipations. This policy is an effort of the
government of Indonesia to support the earlier four policies by strengthening its
international cooperation with other countries, regional and _ international

organizations.

In general, it can be seen that the contemporary cyber security and defense policy of
Indonesia tend to use the strategy of Fortified Cyber Defense (FCD), which requires the

building of a protective environment [12]. This FCD strategy is the most appropriate



strategy for the contemporary condition and resources of Indonesia, compare to the
other two strategies, which are Active Cyber Defense (ACD) that ‘focuses on identifying
and neutralizing threats and threats agents both inside and outside the defender’s
networks’ and

Resilience Cyber

Defense (RCD)

that ‘focuses on

ensuring system

continuity’ (See

Info Box 2).

In term of international cooperation and cyber competency of human resources, the
policy has shown its effectiveness in securing and defending Indonesian cyber
environment. One of example is the success of Indonesia government in cooperation
with the government of China to stop the activity of Asia’s cyber crime network by
arresting 31 Taiwanese, who have been involved and operating their activities in
Indonesia [13]. However, there are still some weaknesses of the policy, which are
primarily caused by the fact that the government of Indonesia has not considered the
cyber security matter as the top priority of security issue that needs an extraordinary

measure.

From legal framework, the policy has not covered some cyber issues that have been
addressed in other countries such as telemedicine, anti-spam, and economic espionage
[14, 15, 16]. Furthermore, five cyber security technical and procedural standards that
have been implemented, have not addressed the other two-cyber threat discourses;
crime-espionage and military defense (see Info Box 1), which potentially result in the
inability to secure critical cyber domain of the country that can be seen from the
espionage activity by Australia towards Indonesian President in 2014 [8]. Moreover,
the effort of the Indonesian government to enable the active role of all entities in
securing and defending cyber network is potentially diminished by the
indistinctiveness of who is authorized to lead the cyber coordination. The late response
of Indonesia cyber units towards DDoS attack to Indonesia Central Bank in 2016 by
Anonymous illustrates the consequence of the nonexistent of this central command
[17]. As a result, if the government of Indonesia does not address these limitations, then
in the meantime the other two success policies mentioned earlier will not optimally be

effective and gradually will be inefficient.



Recommendations:

o Theissue of cyber security must

be considered as the top
priority of government policy
that needs an extraordinary

action

The government must use a
preemptive approach to
providing legal certainty
framework for the cyber policy
by reviewing other countries’
regulations to assess all
possible cyber threats

comprehensively

The policy must provide the
national measure standards for
two other cyber _ security
discourses, which are crime-

espionage and military defense

The government must
authorize one of its agency as
the central commander to lead
and coordinate the
implementation and _ the
organization of all cyber

security and defense policy

o The government must create and build a

dedicated civilian capacity by promoting
cyber security training and education
programs to help in ensuring the
protection of national interest of

Indonesia in cyberspace

The government of Indonesia must play
an effective role as a member of
International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) by boasting the realization of
multilateral agreements in securing
global cyber space and by building a
mutual cooperation with other ITU
member countries that have better cyber

security resources and capacities
